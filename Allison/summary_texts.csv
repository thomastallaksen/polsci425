Separately, the NGO decided not to continue the specific instance process but did not wish to withdraw its filing. Given the union and NGO's positions, the US NCP concluded the specific instance. "

BNP Paribas and Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ar0008.htm,"On 4 July 2011, the Argentinian NCP received a submission by the NGO Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ) alleging that BNP PARIBAS, a French multinational enterprise, did not observe the Guidelines in Argentina."
BNP Paribas and Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ar0008.htm,"The previous NCP office failed to analyse the filling by ACIJ in a timely manner. Thus, this submission was not examined before the restructuring of the Argentinian NCP.  On 2 November 2016, in the context of the work to improve the Argentinian NCP, its new members made a formal offer to the NGO to update its request in order to adequately consider the specific instance. The NCP’s offer did not lead a result. The NCP thus dismissed the claims, closed the specific instance and issued a final statement (Spanish) on 15 December 2016."

The German and US NCPs consulted and agreed that the US NCP would take the lead on the T-Mobile portion while the German NCP would handle the Crnogorski portion."
Telecommunications in USA and Montenegro,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0028.htm,"The trade unions specifically alleged that the activities of some DT/T-Mobile supervisors were, in effect, intimidating workers from exercising freedom of association. In response, DT/T-Mobile argued that CWA’s claims must be resolved under the process set forth under US law and that the NCP process was therefore not the appropriate forum; it also asserted that CWA was using the specific instance to further escalate a public campaign against DT/T-Mobile."
Telecommunications in USA and Montenegro,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0028.htm,"The US NCP clarified that its role was to provide a neutral, third-party facilitated dialogue and not make a determination whether a violation of the Guidelines has occurred, nor does it adjudicate disputes submitted under the process. After the NCP proposed ground rules for mediation, the parties appear receptive to the NCP’s assistance."
Telecommunications in USA and Montenegro,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0028.htm,"On 5 November 2012, the U.S. NCP issued an initial assessment determining that the issues raised by the parties merited further consideration and recommended voluntary, third-party mediation under the auspices of the US Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). "
Telecommunications in USA and Montenegro,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0028.htm,"Expressing numerous questions and concerns, DT/T-Mobile did not agree to a pre-mediation discussion until 26 February 2013.

The NCP did not consider the existence of a parallel proceeding sufficient reason by itself to decide not to offer its good offices, consistent with the procedural guidance of the Guidelines. For their part, the parties did not pursue further involvement from the NCP while the NMB process and contract negotiations were ongoing."

The key allegation of the NGOs is that, by pursuing plans to develop a mine at Phulbari in Bangladesh, GCM failed to respect the rights of communities in that area. The NGOs said that the mine would displace tens of thousands of people who do not have access to appropriate forms of legal or other protection, and that GCM’s plans did not address the adverse impact on these people."

Displacement of local populations and environmental degradation in Bangladesh,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0032.htm,"Following publication of their initial assessment, the NCP examined the issues accepted for further examination and offered mediation to the parties. Neither party was willing to agree to mediation without pre-conditions unacceptable to the other party, so in July 2013, the UK NCP informed the parties that it would undertake a further examination of the substantiated issues, and make findings on the company’s observance of the Guidelines. In response to an invitation from the NCP, both parties then submitted details of additional documents and sources they considered were relevant to a further examination, and the NCP drew on these and relevant third party sources to make its findings."

The statement contained recommendations for the company to continue to update its plans in line with international best practice standards, and in particular to pursue the Human Rights Impact Assessment it has advised the NCP that it will include. The NCP also recommended that GCM develop its communications plans on the basis of a full assessment of risks, including the risks of limiting local engagement, and identifies appropriate ways to re-engage with affected communities, increase the information available to them, and take account of their views."

It was alleged that the mining operations at Luiswishi mine were responsible for the destruction of property in the villages of Kawama and Lukuni-gare which occurred when the police organised an operation to halt clandestine artisanal mining activities."
Destruction of property near a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/be0014.htm,"The NCP met three times with the parties.

The NCP had obtained agreement from the Rachel Forrest Foundation, Forrest Group's humanitarian association, to repair a well, the school and the pharmacy. However this offer was rejected by the inhabitants of the villages as inadequate."

Financial sector in Italy,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/it0006.htm,"The NCP, consulting with the US NCP which had also received the same request, undertook an initial assessment and concluded that the issues raised did not merit further examination. This was because the case had a long-standing history and had already been treated many times in civil and criminal courts. Additionally, the notifier, although referring to Chapter VIII of the Guidelines on consumer interests, couldn’t be considered a consumer, since at the time of the facts he was acting as an entrepreneur."

Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"In December 2011, the Norwegian NCP received a request for review by the NGO Norwegian Support Committee for Western Sahara alleging that Sjovik A.S., which fishes and operates a fish processing plant in the Non-Self-Governing territory of Western Sahara through its subsidiairies Sjovk Africa AS and Sjovik Morocco S.A, has failed to respect the Sahrawi right to self-determination, thereby violating the human rights provisions of the Guidelines."
Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"The company denies that the human rights provisions of the Guidelines are being violated, and underlines that the request seems to be politically motivated and maintained that its investment benefits the Saharawis."
Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"As the Norwegian NCP was the recipient of the request concerning the headquarter policies of a Norwegian-registered multinational enterprise group from the Norwegian Support Committee for Western Sahara. Western Sahara is claimed by Morocco, while no UN organ has recognised Moroccan sovereignty or status as rightful administering power. Western Sahara is recognised as a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the UN. Morocco is committed to following the Guidelines and has established an NCP. The unresolved territorial issues and the fact that the request concerned a Norwegian company favoured the acceptance of the complaint by the Norwegian NCP. The Moroccan NCP was notified about and contributed with information concerning this specific instance."
Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"Joint StatementAfter the initial assessment where the NCP found the complaint to be substantiated and sufficiently linked to the Guidelines, both parties initially rejected the NCP’s offer to facilitate mediation. However, they both reverted on 27 May 2012 to accept the offer. The parties reached an agreement after mediation conducted by former Supreme Court judge and former director of the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime, Lars Oftedal Broch, on behalf of NCP Norway. The parties’ board chairmen signed the joint statement on 2 July in Molde, Norway. As a consequence the complaint was withdrawn."
Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"The joint statement refers to the parties’ disagreement on whether Sjøvik AS should operate in Western Sahara. The parties agree to request Norwegian authorities to give unambiguous advice to businesses operating in conflict areas. They also agree that Sjøvik AS shall carry out environmental and social impact assessment for its activities based on the principles set out in the new OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and publish content in the report in accordance with the OECD Guidelines, chapter III (Disclosure). Sjøvik will also publish “codes of conduct” and make sure that its internal grievance mechanism meets the Guidelines’ requirements by the end of 2013."
Fisheries and fish processing in Western Sahara,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0007.htm,"RecommendationsSince the mediation in this specific instance reached a successful conclusion, the NCP has not examined the merits of the claims in the complaint. The NCP nevertheless underscores on a general basis that there is a heightened due diligence requirement for business in relation to human rights violations when operating in or from areas in conflict. The NCP also encourages the company to draw on human rights expertise on how to conduct the human rights impact assessment for Sjøvik’s activities in Western Sahara. The NCP furthermore recommends that the parties continue their dialogue, and invites both parties to a follow-up meeting tentatively on 15 May 2014."

Oil spills in the Niger Delta,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0018.htm,"In January 2011, the Dutch NCP received a request for review from three NGOs, Friends of the Earth International, Friends of the Earth Netherlands, and Amnesty International, alleging that Royal Dutch Shell had breached the disclosure, environment, and consumer interests provisions of the Guidelines in Nigeria with respect to its communication on oil spills in the Niger Delta."
Oil spills in the Niger Delta,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0018.htm,"According to the NGOs, the company had provided misleading information and omitted relevant facts about the causes of oil spills. They claimed that Shell based its communications on biased and unverified information, thus failing to provide reliable and relevant details to external stakeholders. In addition, incorrect and conflicting messages about the causes of oil spills further contributed to the low quality of non-financial information."
Oil spills in the Niger Delta,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0018.htm,"The specific instance process was led by the Dutch NCP with the support of the UK NCP who has also been contacted by the NGOs. It was conducted as a dialogue between the parties involved, and although helpful discussions took place during the meetings, the parties did not reach an agreement. During those meetings, the issue of confidentially was discussed at length as Shell was asking a guarantee from the NGOs that these cases would not be part of a campaign or appear in a public domain. Friends of the Earth and Amnesty International could not guarantee such thing since campaigning is at the heart of their actions."
Oil spills in the Niger Delta,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0018.htm,"The NCP regretted that the parties could not find a solution to this dilemma, and in concluding the specific instance, it released a statement containing recommendations on due diligence in the supply chain and transparency."

"Environmental issues in the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0029.htm,"After several exchanges and examination of the documentation provided by the parties, it appeared to the US NCP that the principal motive for the notifier was to obtain a financial settlement, which is beyond the scope of an NCP's responsibilities. The individual also showed a substantial lack of co-operation and misused confidental information obtained via the specific instance process. This undermined the establishment of the environment of trust necessary for facilitating a mediate resolution to a dispute."

Human rights in Kosovo,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0006.htm,In June 2011 the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from Dianne Post representing 129 Roma in Kosovo who alleged that Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) breached the human rights and environment provisions of the Guidelines for not having prevented exposure to serious and lethal health risks due to detrimental conditions in the refugee camp that it managed.
Human rights in Kosovo,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0006.htm,"The notifiers alleged that, following the 1999 NATO bombing of Kosovo, Roma who did not flee Kosovo were placed in camps for internally displaced persons. The camps were allegedly located on land contaminated with lead or land that was used as a toxic waste dump site. As a result, the inhabitants of the camps experienced severe health problems. Although NCA did not set up the camps itself, it managed one camp in the region on behalf of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and later on behalf of the local government. Since NCA managed the camp, the complainants hold the organisation responsible for alleged negative health impacts caused by exposure to lead poisoning as well as the lack of basic hygiene and sufficient food."
Human rights in Kosovo,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0006.htm,"The notifiers claimed that Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) should be viewed as a Multinational Enterprise (MNE) on the grounds that it receives nearly half of its income from public funds and operates internationally. The specific instance was rejected however by the Norwegian NCP, which concluded that it was not against a “company” as understood by the Guidelines."
Human rights in Kosovo,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0006.htm,"The Norwegian NCP consulted with the OECD Annual NCP Meeting held by the OECD Investment Committee, which supported the view that NCA did not qualify as an MNE. The specific instance therefore fell beyond the range of the Guidelines and the mandate of the NCP and could not be accepted for consideration."

Car manufacturing plant closure in France,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0015.htm,"The French NCP could not contact or meet with the company as it was undergoing judicial liquidation. Nevertheless, in its final statement the NCP concluded that Molex has not fulfilled the information and cooperation obligation under the Guidelines for the following reasons: (1) the decision to close the site was already taken when the process of information and consultation was initiated, (2) the information provided could not lead to an appropriate job protection plan and (3) the company did not cooperate to mitigate the negative impacts of the closure.  "

Environmentally harmful products in the UK,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0027.htm,"After undertaking an initial assessment, the UK NCP concluded that the request did not merit further consideration on the grounds that some aspects of the complaint have not been sufficiently substantiated, and further consideration of any aspects of the complaint would not contribute to the purposes and effectiveness of the Guidelines."

As ArcelorMittal is based in Luxembourg, the specific instance was transferred to the Luxembourg NCP, while the Netherlands NCP plays a supporting role."
Mining in Liberia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lu0001.htm,"Among numerous allegations, FoE and SDI’s concerns included:"
Mining in Liberia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lu0001.htm,ArcelorMittal rejected the allegations made against it.
Mining in Liberia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lu0001.htm,"The Luxembourg NCP determined that it was outside the mandate of the NCP to judge whether ArcelorMittal had acted in compliance with domestic or international law and thus excluded the first allegation regarding the pick-up trucks from the complaints procedure. The NCP believed FoE provided sufficient information on the remaining allegations and, after completing the initial assessment, it offered to provide mediation assistance to both parties. The parties agreed to mediation by an expert mediator, Dr. Maartje can Putten, with the aim to draft a proposal for improving management of the CSDF. Two fact-finding missions took place and the parties met multiple times in 2012 and 2013. The end result was a mutually-agreed upon document recommending that the CSDF be transformed into a Trust or Foundation as an independent body composed of representatives from the government, civil society organizations, and ArcelorMittal. In addition, a ‘board for grievances’ would be available to hear appeals concerning funded projects.

Public administration and defence in Australia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0001.htm,The NCP met separately with representatives from the NGOs and GSL Australia and the NCP determined that it would be appropriate to accept as a specific instance those matters raised by the NGOs that could be shown to relate directly to the conduct of GSL Australia and were within its control. The ANCP also determined that it would not be appropriate to accept those parts of the NGO's submission that sought to address the Australian Government’s mandatory detention policy because the Guidelines do not provide an appropriate avenue to review a host government’s domestic policy settings.
Public administration and defence in Australia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0001.htm,"The NGOs and GSL Australia respectively agreed to participate in a mediation session convened by the NCP.

This statement was endorsed by the First Federal Judge of the 6th Labor Court in Sao Bernardo do Campo, SP who had declared that the company had acted in accordance with the law regarding the dismissal of that employee, having paid him correctly all the legal severance dues and in a timely fashion. Taking this into account, the NCP considered that it was inappropriate to continue analysing a request that had already been judged in a court of law and subsequently concluded that it could not accept the specific instance. "

Interference with striking workers in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0009.htm,"The NCP accepted the specific instance for further consideration and requested more information from the parties. Itaú-Unibanco responded stating that it recognised the right to strike and that the document that had been at the origin of the trade unions' request did not constitute an anti-union practice, rather that its intention was to ensure the right to work of the employees that did not join the strike. The trade unions responded in turn that the bank had theatened the strikers and that there had been alleged attempts to force workers to attend the workplace which had resulted in harsh police action and the arrest of a trade unionist."

Responsibility for contractual workers in the Philippines and Indonesia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0001.htm,"The NCP took steps to obtain information in the specific instance, among other things through the Norwegian embassy.

Human rights in Guantanamo Bay prison,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0002.htm,"In June 2005 the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from the NGO Forum for Environment and Development (ForUM) alleging that, through its wholly owned US subsidiary Kværner Process Services Inc. (KPSI), Aker Kværner was in breach of the provision of the OECD Guidelines regarding respect for human rights in that it provided assistance to the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The prison was established to house prisoners suspected of terrorism, and it was criticised because the prisoners were denied due process protection.The specific instance concerned the question of whether Aker Kværner had aided and abetted, or profited from, violations of human rights. Ethical evaluations of such issues are based on the human rights provision of the OECD Guidelines. Aker Kværner/KPSI was primarily involved in the running of the base, but it also contributed to maintenance and operational and supply functions that are common to the prison and the base."
Human rights in Guantanamo Bay prison,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0002.htm,The NCP had meetings with Aker Kværner and ForUM in September and  October 2005 to discuss the complaint submitted by ForUM and assist the parties in reaching agreement on this issue.
Human rights in Guantanamo Bay prison,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0002.htm,"The NCP was of the view that the company’s activities must, at least in part, be deemed to affect the inmates of the prison. The running of the prison is dependent on the maintenance of infrastructure of the type involved in this complaint. The NCP emphasised that Norwegian companies should continuously evaluate their operations in relation to human rights. The situation at Guantanamo called for particular vigilance.

Nikel project in the Philippines,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0004.htm,"In January 2009 the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from the NGO Future in Our Hands alleging that Intex had breached the general policies, environment and combating bribery provisions of the Guidelines by having conducted flawed consultations with indigenous populations and engaged in bribery and corruption, and through the potential for serious environmental damage if the project continued."
Nikel project in the Philippines,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0004.htm,"Intex rejected the NCP's offer of good offices. The NCP received two embassy reports on the issues, and contracted a social anthropologist to examine the allegations. The NCP concluded in a 50 page report (see final statement and report) that the OECD Guidelines are applicable to enterprises that are still at a planning or exploratory stage of their operations. Abiding by national law is not in itself sufficient for compliance with the Guidelines. "
Nikel project in the Philippines,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0004.htm,"The NCP concluded that the company was in breach of the human rights provisions of the Guidelines because it had not consulted broadly enough with the indigenous peoples affected by the project and associated infrastructure. The NCP did not find evidence that the company had been involved in bribery or corruption, but recommended that the company establish a sound managerial system to manage such risks, particularly since the operations were in a country figuring at the lower part of international corruption indexes. Nor did the NCP find that Intex had violated the Guidelines by supporting a community development project. However, Intex did not have a transparent, publicly disclosed system for allocating development funds. Local populations were worried that mining could exacerbate flood problems, pollute rice fields, and impact biodiversity, water quality, agriculture, and tourism potential. The NCP found that Intex had conducted a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), but did not sufficiently distinguish between significant and less significant risks. The EIA had not been disseminated as required by Philippine legislation, nor did it provide adequate information about a number of important aspects of the project or sufficient baseline studies."

Founded partly on meetings that were held with the aim of contributing to a solution by means of discussion and dialogue, and partly on questions and answers that were exchanged between the parties concerned, with the NCP acting as facilitator and intermediary, the Swedish NCP has not found indications to support the allegations made about Nordea having violated the Guidelines in its part-financing of Botnia’s pulp mill in Uruguay. Moreover, the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) environmental study on the project and visits made to Uruguay by trade union organisations have strengthened this assessment."

Employment and industrial relations during a lockout in the USA,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0003.htm,"In November 2008 the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from the Norwegian United Federation of Trade Unions (Fellesforbundet) alleging that Kongsberg Automotive had breached the employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines because the company’s subsidiary in Ohio, USA, Kongsberg Driveline System, had hired alternative labour during a lockout. Fellesforbundet was of the view that the parent company Kongsberg Automotive had breached the Guidelines by accepting such a course of action."
Employment and industrial relations during a lockout in the USA,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0003.htm,"The Norwegian NCP underlined that the use of hired labour during a labour dispute is not in keeping with Norwegian practices and tradition. In the NCP’s view, it has become part of Norwegian parent companies’ corporate social responsibility to encourage their foreign subsidiaries to observe Norwegian labour traditions insofar as is practicable. The NCP therefore recommended that Kongsberg Automotive takes such considerations into account should a similar situation arise in the future."
Employment and industrial relations during a lockout in the USA,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0003.htm,"The majority of the NCP was nevertheless of the view that Kongsberg Automotive’s conduct in connection with the dispute cannot be said to constitute a breach of the Guidelines. The ILO conventions on which the provisions of the Guidelines are based were also taken into account in the assessment. The minority of the NCP, which consists of the representative from the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), was of the view that the hiring of alternative labour during the lockout constituted a breach of the OECD Guidelines in that it is a breach of non-statutory law and Norwegian tradition and culture in this area. The minority has also taken the ILO conventions into account in its assessment. "

Salmon farming in Canada and Chile ,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0005.htm,"In May 2005 the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from the NGOs Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature/Friends of the Earth Norway and the Forum for Environment and Development (ForUM) alleging that the partially state-owned Norwegian company Cermaq ASA had breached the provisions of the Guidelines, claiming it did not take adequate account of indigenous peoples' rights, that it engaged in discriminating trade union practices, and that it conducted flawed environmental due diligence. The Norwegian NCP consulted with the Chilean and Canadian NCPs who both agreed that the issues merited further examination. The NGOs stated that they wanted changes in the policies at Cermaq's headquarters so that operations abroad would accordingly be adjusted. The company agreed and so did the Norwegian, Chilean and Canadian NCPs, and the Norwegian NCP took the lead in the specific instance. The Chilean and Canadian NCPs provided invaluable input throughout the process. After a series of meetings and examination of the documentation provided by the parties, the Norwegian NCP offered to mediate between the parties. A joint statement was published on 11 August 2011 giving the outcomes of this mediation. The statement describes how Cermaq will operate according to the precautionary principle (as defined in the Guidelines, including discussion of scientific uncertainty), respect indigenous peoples' rights, human rights, labour rights and sustainability reporting. The statement acknowledges that Cermaq, after major outbreaks of the virus infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Chile, has contributed to knowledge development to make the industry more sustainable. The parties agree that there are accusations in the request for review that have been refuted and that future contact should be based on mutual trust and clarification of facts. The NGOs entrusted Cermaq with their confidence that the company will follow through on its implementation of the actions outlined in the joint statement. The Norwegian NCP facilitated a follow-up meeting and invited the parties to present the joint statement at the Annual OECD meeting of NCPs in June 2012 and at a seminar in Chile in November 2012."

Statkraft AS and the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/se0004.htm,"In October 2012 the Swedish and Norwegian NCPs received a submission from the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village alleging that Statkraft AS, a Norwegian multinational enterprise, had not observed the general policies, human rights, and environment provisions of the Guidelines by planning to build a wind power plant on reindeer herding ground in Sweden. The Sami reindeer herding collective acknowledge that Statkraft had consulted with the community during the planning stages of the wind power plant, but content that ""meaningful engagement"" had not taken place. They requested that the NCPs mediate between the parties to reach such a positive solution to the situation.The NCPs met with both parties during the initial assessment process. The NCPs had decided to defer the case as a bilateral dialogue between the parties had been renewed since the request for review was received by the NCPs. In September 2013, however, the Saami village again requested the NCPs to facilitate mediation and a mediation process was initiated. Mediation took place during the course of 2014 but no agreement could be reached. "
Statkraft AS and the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/se0004.htm,"The NCPs of Sweden and Norway have therefore assessed Statkraft’s compliance with the OECD Guidelines, which they present in their joint final statement along with their recommendations for future cooperation. For various reasons, the process has taken a disproportionately long time, and the NCPs regret this.  "
Statkraft AS and the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/se0004.htm,"The main question in the complaint is whether Statkraft has taken account of the Saami village’s interests and respected their human rights in connection with the wind power project, including carrying out risk-based human rights diligence and consulting with the Saami village. "
Statkraft AS and the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/se0004.htm,"The NCPs have not found any grounds for concluding that Statkraft has failed to comply with the OECD Guidelines. The NCPs have pointed to some areas where there is room for improvement, including that Statkraft/Statkraft SCA Vind AB (SSVAB) can work in a manner that even more clearly promotes indigenous people’s rights and the implementation of the Guidelines."
Statkraft AS and the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/se0004.htm,"The NCPs recommend that the parties show renewed will to negotiate an agreement on the further development of the wind power projects, their scope and extent and compensation schemes.  "

"Michelin Group, and four NGOs and a trade union",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0016.htm,"During 2012 and 2013, the NCP offered its good offices to the parties. During this time, the NCP noted persistent differences between the parties which impeded its mediation efforts. In July 2013, the NCP completed its analysis of the specific instance and the draft commmuniqué to the parties for comment. At the end of this consultation in September 2013, the company accepted the NCP’s decisions and committed to co-operate with it. The complainants however publicly announced the withdrawal of their specific instance and criticised the work of the NCP on several occasions during 2013 and 2014. In this context, the NCP first issued a Communiqué on 24 September 2013 to announce that it would still publish its decision. The NCP’s report was published on 27 September 2013. On 7 October 2013, the NCP also issued a statement in response to the criticism by the NGOs' and trade union's criticisms."

The NCP noted that the Michelin Group did not violate the OECD Guidelines, although several recommendations of the OECD Guidelines were not adequately complied with or not fully implemented. The NCP regretted that an impact study could not be conducted earlier. This was due to the parties' failure to come to an agreement since 2010 on the terms of reference and the implementation conditions. The NCP noted that, as a result of its good offices, the Michelin Group has undertaken preparatory steps for environmental, social and human rights impact assessment studies study for the industrial project in Tamil Nadu (India). The Michelin Group also committed to developing a subsequent action plan to adapt its CSR policy and internal due diligence systems in response to the outcomes of the studies. The NCP appreciated the Michelin Group's cooperation, the level of transparency it provided and its renewed willingness to dialogue with the NCP. Furthermore, the NCP requested that the Michelin Group take into account its recommendations in order to ensure compliance with the Guidelines, first in the start-up phase of the production on the site, as well as in the development of the industrial project. The NCP decided to follow up on its recommendations."

Several meetings have taken place between the NCP and the enterprise. The NCP adopted an initial follow-up statement in May 2014. This was published after consultation with the company. It reports on the measures taken by the Michelin Group, notably the launch of the impact assessment studies and the actions taken to strengthen dialogue with its stakeholders at the group’s level. The NCP released a second and final follow-up statement in February 2016 published after consultation with the Michelin Group. After three years of proceedings, the NCP congratulates the Michelin Group for having integrated due diligence into its policy and strategy not only in Tamil Nadu but also globally.

In its final statement, the UK NCP did not propose to make any recommendations because a considerable period of time has passed since the privatisation process was concluded. However, the NCP noted that both parties engaged in a constructive dialogue throughout the case and shared a great deal of information, which resulted in the clarification of a complex case and a deeper mutual understanding."
"Oil infrastructure project in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0002.htm,The UK NCP issued three statements related to this specific instance:
"Oil infrastructure project in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0002.htm,"In April 2003, the UK NCP received a request for review from several NGOs alleging that BTC Corporation (BTC) had breached the concepts and principles, general policies, disclosure, and environment provisions of the Guidelines in relation with the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, an oil infrastructure project crossing Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The NGOs also contacted the French, German and US NCPs with regard to their concerns. The UK NCP lead the work on this specific instance with input and close co-ordination with the other NCPs involved.*"
"Oil infrastructure project in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0002.htm,"The NGOs specifically alleged that the company exerted undue influence on the regulatory framework, sought and accepted exemptions related to social, labour, tax and environmental laws, failed to operate in a manner contributing to the wider goals of sustainable development, failed to adequately consult with communities affected by the project and undermined the host governments' ability to mitigate serious threat to the environment and human health & safety.The NCP's analysis of the specific instance resulted in a final statement in 2007. However, this original statement was withdrawn following a procedural review by the UK NCP Steering Board, which identified a flaw in the process followed by the UK NCP, namely that the NCP had not provided an opportunity for the NGOs to see and comment on a report by BP, BCT’s largest shareholder. A revised final statement was issued with revised recommendations to the company taking into account the report by BP.After analysing the NGOs' comments on the BP report, the UK NCP concluded that BCT had not failed to comply with the Guidelines regarding the negotiation and constraints of  the BCT legal framework and the compensation process, including concerns over not contributing to sustainable development. The NCP however found  that BCT had failed to address compensation and grievance concerns in the north-east of Turkey, such as concerns of intimidation by local partners, and consequently breached the employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines (Chapter Ve paragraph 2 (b)). Therefore, the UK NCP recommended that the company consider and report on ways that it could strengthen procedures to identify and respond to reports of alleged intimidation.The NCP's follow up statement evaluated the progress made by BCT in implementing the UK NCP’s recommendations. In light of the responses by the parties it was determined that BTC had taken steps to identify ways to strengthen its procedures for recording and responding to reports of intimidation. However, the UK NCP remained concerned that BTC made no reference to a number of important issues, for example the setting up of a grievance management process. The UK NCP thus encouraged BTC to implement all of the identified ways of strengthening the company’s procedure."

Privatisation of industry in Zambia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0003.htm,"On the basis of the lack of information provided by CBE and the passage of time since a detailed response was provided by National Grid Transco (17 months), the NCP concluded that the complaint was closed for want of prosecution."

Wind energy project in Turkey,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/tr0002.htm,"The Turkish NCP undertook an initial assessment by focusing on whether the questions raised by the notifiers merited in-depth examination.

Wind energy project in Turkey,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/tr0002.htm,"The NGO also raised concerns which the NCP concluded were related to corporate social responsibility practices of the company at a global scale.

The trade union argued that the plant was closed in violation of the domestic law and instigated a strike.Due to procedural reasons it was determined that the Mexican NCP would lead the review with the support of the German NCP. The relevant authorities in Mexico were consulted and meetings were held with the parties involved and with other governmental agencies.After several months of negotiations, the Mexican subsidiary was taken over by a joint venture formed between a Mexican company and a co-operative of former workers.

The NCP concluded that APG, which manages the investments of ABP and other pension funds, has taken its responsibility as a minority shareholder and acted in accordance with the Guidelines. However, constructive dialogue between POSCO and all stakeholders will be key to improve the situation on the ground. An independent review and assessment mission could help launch such a dialogue.

(ASR) had breached the general policies, and human rights provisions of the Guidelines. The NGOs raised concerns over human rights-related violations connected to its Koh Kong sugar plantation and refinery in Cambodia. More specifically, it was alleged that villagers were forcibly evicted with no public consultation, social or environmental impact assessment or settlement plan. The NGOs contended that ASR, by virtue of its supply chain relationship with the Koh Kong plantation, had an obligation to avoid contributing to conduct inconsistent with the Guidelines. Regarding the supply chain relationship, the NGOs stated that ASR purchased sugar produced at the plantation through the UK-based company, T&L Sugars Ltd."
Agricultural investment in Cambodia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0033.htm,The US NCP conducted an initial assessment of the specific instance and found sufficient reasons to offer its good offices to facilitate a discussion between the parties.

Workers rights in the Philippines,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0035.htm,"In May 2013, the US NCP received a request for a review from the Federation of Free Workers (FFW), a Philippines-based trade union confederation, alleging that Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson (Philippines), Inc., a corporation incorporated in the Philippines and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (J&J), had breached employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines in the Philippines.FFW claimed that managers at Janssen’s sales office in Paranaque City, the Philippines, set unreasonable sales performance benchmarks which they used as a pretext to dismiss certain workers. While Janssen maintains the workers were dismissed because they failed to meet the performance benchmarks, FFW claims the workers were dismissed for engaging in unionizing activities. FFW contended these actions were inconsistent with the principles of the Guidelines. On 6 June, the NCP received Janssen’s formal response, in which Janssen disputed FFW’s characterization of its managers’ actions and provided evidence to support its stance. The NCP determined that the issues raised in the specific instance do not merit further examination and declined to offer good offices to seek a mediated resolution between FFW and Janssen. FFW provided insufficient substantiation to support its allegations. Further, Philippine arbitrators have determined Janssen had justification for dismissing or seeking the resignation of the employees identified by FFW and found no evidence of company retaliation because of the union officials’ positions or activities. The same allegations have been considered and decided, in some cases several times, by multiple levels of the Philippine court and labour arbitration system, who found no evidence of company retaliation because of the union officials’ positions or activities.While court and arbitral decisions alone do not necessarily preclude the involvement of the NCP, in the absence of stronger substantiated concerns that Janssen policies or practices may be inconsistent with the cited provisions of the Guidelines, the NCP concluded that its involvement would not further the effectiveness of the Guidelines."

More specifically, the NGO alleged that one of the UK banks (Bank C) had a business relationship with Company R as one of a group of financial enterprises providing a Project Finance Facility for the construction and commissioning of the production complex.

The NCP appointed an external conciliator-mediator and conciliation meetings were held in May and July 2010. However, mediation was not required as the parties agreed on a mutually acceptable solution to the issues through conciliation. The full text of this agreement is found in the final statement issued by the NCP on 18 October 2010. The UK NCP accordingly concluded the specific instance."

However, the NCP considered that BATM had failed to uphold high standards on employment and industrial relations by failing to consult BATEU about the company's restructuring. The NCP therefore recommended that British American Tobacco should encourage BATM to establish a permanent and regular process to consult and inform its employees before key decisions of mutual concern are taken. A follow-up statement was issued and examines whether British American Tobacco and BATM had made progress in implementing the NCP’s recommendations. The NCP welcomed the steps taken by BATM to minimise the risk of future breaches of the Guidelines."

She alleged that the company had violated her human rights and her rights as an employee and that, when presented with the evidence of these violations, the company had not investigated the matter with due diligence."
Alleged violation of employee rights in Russia,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0018.htm,"The NCP undertook an initial assessment and, in September 2013, concluded that the specific instance did not merit further consideration. Read the NCP's statement (in German)."
Alleged violation of employee rights in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0019.htm,"In June 2013 the German NCP received a request for a review from an individual alleging that a subsidiary of a German multinational enterprise had breached the general policies, and human rights provisions of the Guidelines in Brazil. The individual claimed that the company engaged in discriminatory and disciplinary action against her after she made a bona fide report against alleged grievances in the company."
Alleged violation of employee rights in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0019.htm,"The German NCP undertook an initial assessment and concluded that, according to the Guidelines' implementation procedures, the Brazilian NCP should handle this request. The request was subsequently transferred to the Brazilian NCP in September 2013."
Alleged violation of employee rights in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0019.htm,"In undertaking its own initial assessment, the Brazilian NCP noted that the request had failed to fulfill two requirements necessary for it to be accepted for further examination, these being: "
Alleged violation of employee rights in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0019.htm,"In the first instance, the individual didn't manifest her interest in having the notification dealt by the Brazilian NCP, and, in the second instance, the NCP determined that the notification related to her dismissal by the company in 2008, more than 12 months from the date of receipt of the notification by the Brazilian NCP, thus rendering the notification invalid according to the NCPs procedural rules."
Alleged violation of employee rights in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0019.htm,"Subsequently, on 27 November 2013, the individual informed the Brazilian NCP that the notification was not related to her dismissal, rather that ""it was about a breach of paragraph 13 [of the OECD Guidelines], protection of whistleblowers in good faith, and refered to a situation that occurred in 2010 that led to the dismissal of the Chief Compliance Officer of the company in South America.”. However, this places the events as having occurred in 2010 which was still more than 12 months prior to the date of notification to the Brazilian NCP. Accordingly the NCP did not accept the specific instance for further examination. "

The bank also allegedly refused to engage in collective bargaining with the unions and had dismissed union leaders while transferring other union representatives to other locations."
Workers rights issues in Peru,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/cl0004.htm,"The Labour Court in Peru had ruled in favour of the unions and ordered the bank to reinstate the dismissed workers, however the bank sought appeals against this ruling."
Workers rights issues in Peru,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/cl0004.htm,"The Chilean NCP concluded that the specific instance merited further consideration, however by that time, the bank had been taken over by Scotiabank, headquartered in Canada.

More specifically, the NGO alleged that oil exploration was in conflict with international agreements – particularly regarding the Park’s status as a World Heritage site – and DRC law and posed risks to the local environment and local communities dependent upon the surrounding ecosystem. SOCO, while denying the allegations, welcomed constructive dialogue with WWF. SOCO stated that its activities were still limited to environmental and social studies and social programmes, including a seismic survey on behalf of the DRC government, rather than actual oil exploration."

With the NCP’s assistance, the parties reached an agreement in June 2014. SOCO agreed with WWF in a joint statement to refrain from any exploratory or other drilling within Virunga National Park for as long as UNESCO and the DRC government view such activities as incompatible with the Park’s World Heritage Status. SOCO will complete its current seismic survey and will honour its commitments to local inhabitants to continue its social programmes as long as the company holds rights to the Block V license.

Violations of the general policies of the Guidelines in Poland,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/pl0002.htm,"In February 2014, the Polish NCP received a request for review by a trade union and individuals alleging that a multinational enterprise had breached the general policies provisions of the Guidelines in Poland. "
Violations of the general policies of the Guidelines in Poland,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/pl0002.htm,"The request did not specify the allegations and only indicated the part of the Guidelines which had been breached. Based on the notification as well as on additional information acquired during the preparation of the assessment, the NCP found that the allegation concerns a dismissal of an employee resulting from enquiries about the lawfulness of the property sale by one of the companies belonging to the capital group.Due to a lack of documentation regarding the dismissal of the aggrieved, however, as well as evidence of another reason directly related to the dismissal, the case is not deemed material and substantiated. Further, the notifying party breached its obligation not to communicate with the public about the allegations and sent relevant information to third parties. It was also found that the trade union's request contained false information that the case had been sent to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.The Polish NCP determined that to offer its good offices in relation to this specific instance would be to risk negatively affecting the integrity of the NCP itself, undermining its reliability and the possibility of acting in other instances in the future. The NCP duly concluded the specific instance."

This co-operation was based on a joint statement between the company and UNI Global Union to conduct a dialogue and find a joint solution. Following two workshops and a dialogue session, the parties reach a mutually beneficial agreement and the employees that had been dismissed legally were in the meantime rehired. On 4 April 2014, the trade union notified the NCP that it desired to terminate the specific instances since the parties had reached an agreement.

Bribery allegations in India,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0010.htm,"In March 2014, the Norwegian NCP received an anonymous complaint about conditions at a subsidiary of a Norwegian company in India. The individual claimed that the local management has been involved in bribery and  that the parent company had not responded to a complaint via the company’s whistleblower channel. The NCP was asked to investigate the matter with a view to punish the local management."
Bribery allegations in India,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0010.htm,"After conducting an initial assessment of the specific instance, the NCP has concluded that it does not merit further consideration. While recognising that there may be legitimate reasons to be anonymous, the NCP is concerned that it would be too difficult to assess whether the person has a legitimate interest in the matter and the suggestion that the individual choose third-party representation was declined. Further, the individual’s desire that the NCP conduct an investigation is beyond the NCP’s authority. The NCP has however provided some recommendations and observations to the company to identity, prevent, mitigate and manage the risks associated with bribery which are available in the initial assessment issued by the NCP.

Forced labour in Uzbekistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/kr0012.htm,"The NCP undertook an initial assessment of the specific instance and, in July 2015, concluded that it did not merit further consideration. While acknowledging the link between the enterprises’ activity and the issue of forced labour, the NCP did not consider that serious adverse impacts had been caused or encouraged by the business activities in question. The NCP also considered that the companies were not in a position to use leverage vis-a-vis the Uzbekistan government. The NCP also observed that the companies had already created internal guidelines for ethical business conduct, and in compliance with these internal guidelines, they had tried to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts in various ways. The NCP also took into consideration the outcome of a similar specific instance raised with the Norwegian NCP which was also rejected for further consideration."
Forced labour in Uzbekistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/kr0012.htm,"While not accepting the specific instance, the Korean NCP, recommends that the companies continue to monitor the situation and respond actively to every possible way concerning the issues related by means of dialogue and co-operation with the government of Uzbekistan, state-owned companies, related international organisations, NGOs, and local communities."

The NCP contacted the parties involved and encouraged them to engage in dialogue to reach a mutual solution and shortly thereafter, the trade union contacted the NCP to withdraw the specific instance, saying that an agreement had been arrived at during a joint meeting. The NCP, however, didn't feel that the terms of the agreement addressed all the allegations, specifically the gross alleged violations of Guidelines, particularly the withholding of employee passports.

Environmental issues relating to the construction of a harbour,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/be0015.htm,"Throughout these series of meetings, the company explained its position and demonstrated that it had undertaken sufficient environmental due diligence in relation to the project in question.

Alleged general policy breaches in Israel and the Palestinian Authority,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0040.htm,"The NCP therefore offered the parties mediation. Mediation is voluntary and a specific instance only proceeds to mediation where both parties accept the offer. In this case, LPHR accepted the offer of mediation, but G4S declined, explaining that it considered that legally binding obligations of contractual confidentiality would limit its ability to discuss the issues, making mediation impracticable, and also because G4S did not accept that the LPHR had a mandate to negotiate and resolve the issues. "

It considered that the two specific recommendations (recommendations a. and b. above) had not been implemented by G4S. The NCP considered that the general recommendation (recommendation c. above) had been implemented by G4S, based on the firm’s report which included a wider CSR report.

Labour rights in Pakistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0038.htm,"In March 2014 the US NCP received a request for review from the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Works’ Associations (IUF) alleging that Mondelez International had breached the concepts and principles, general policies, and employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines at a Cadbury factory in Pakistan. Specifically it was alleged that the decline in number of direct employment contracts (only 49 out of a total workforce of nearly 700 at the time of the request), constituted an abuse of worker rights."
Labour rights in Pakistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0038.htm,"Mondalez rejected these allegations, arguing that the IUF was inappropriately using the NCP process and interfering in legitimate local bargaining. It pointed to the successful negotiations that recently occurred between the local union and company representatives as proof of a pre-existing and robust national legal framework. In a subsequent update, Mondalez notified the NCP that a collective agreement, using the collective bargaining framework, was reached on 8 May 2014."
Labour rights in Pakistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0038.htm,"On the basis of this information and other evidence, the NCP determined that there to be no compelling evidence that Mondalez is not in compliance with Pakistani law. It did find, however, that the issue of causal/contract workers may merit further examination and may not be consistent with the spirit of the employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines."
Labour rights in Pakistan,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0038.htm,"The NCP has deferred its offer of good offices, remains however it remains open to revisiting issues related to the collective bargaining agreement between Cadbury and Mondelez and full time employees if both parties are willing to engage. In its final statement, the NCP also recommended that IUF engage directly with the agencies of the contract workers as a more expedient method of addressing the alleged inconsistencies in fair labour practice."

"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"In November 2013, the US NCP received a specific instance from the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Works’ Associations (IUF) alleging that PepsiCo India, a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. did not observe the Guidelines in India."
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"Specifically it was alleged that between 5 January and 30 April 2013, 162 workers of 170 employed at 3 West Bengal warehouses contracted exclusively by PepsiCo were dismissed or compelled to resign solely as a consequence of exercising their right to join a union. IUF stated that PepsiCo, through its subsidiary in India, contracts these workers through Radhakrishna Food Land Pvt. Ltd. (RKFL), and in this capacity has facilitated workers’ rights abuses through this subcontracting relationship. According to the IUF, PepsiCo had failed to perform the required human rights due diligence and therefore tacitly allowed these violations to persist. "
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"In response, PepsiCo emphasized that the IUF’s complaint focused on the alleged actions of its contractor, and not PepsiCo or its subsidiary. PepsiCo maintains that the strike that led to the termination of the workers was illegal, as the strikers did not provide the required notice under Indian law. Regardless, PepsiCo stated that it did in fact use its relationship with RKFL to secure offers of re-employment to 28 of the workers that the IUF claims were specific victims of human rights violations. PepsiCo claims that the ultimate reason for the IUF complaint rests not on the alleged violations of the Guidelines in its relationship with RKFL; rather it stems from PepsiCo’s refusal to enter into a formal global “relationship” with the IUF. Because it had already engaged in multiple discussions with the IUF and investigated their claims, PepsiCo declined the NCP's offer of mediation."
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"The NCP offered its good office for mediation with the view that it might further dialogue between RKFL and its employees, supported by the IUF and PepsiCo."
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"On 14 March 2014 PepsiCo responded that it had already engaged in discussions directly with the IUF and because of the inability to reach an agreement on the issues in question, PepsiCo declined the NCP’s offer of mediation. The NCP therefore concluded the specific instance and issued a public statement regarding the outcomes."
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"In November 2015, PepsiCo reached out to the NCP to ask if mediation would still be available. The NCP agreed to mediate the case and both parties returned to the table.  Although they were not able to reach a mediated agreement, the parties and the USNCP found the dialogue and mediation process to be productive and useful.  On 15 April 2016, the NCP released a final statement concluding the specific instance in which it recommended that PepsiCo update its Human Rights Workplace Policy, committing itself explicitly to the Guidelines and incorporating the human rights and labour chapters of the Guidelines as the standard for PepsiCo activities. PepsiCo has informed the USNCP that an update is already underway."
"PepsiCo India and the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Association (IUF)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0037.htm,"The NCP commends both parties for their willingness to continue to work to resolve these issues and for their decision to return to the Specific Instance, even after it had been declared concluded, to make an attempt at a mediated solution."
Employment issues in the USA,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0007.htm,"In June 2003, the US NCP received a request for review by a trade union alleging that a US subsidiary of a French company had breached the employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines in the USA. Specifically the trade union raised concerns about the collective bargaining process at the company's plant in Massachusetts."
Employment issues in the USA,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0007.htm,The NCP offered its good offices but the company expressed its desire to address the matter through US labour law procedures. The NCP ended its involvement and concluded the specific instance after workers at the company voted to decertify the trade union as their representative.

"Security sector issues in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0045.htm,"In August 2014 the UK NCP received a request for review from an NGO alleging that a US subsidiary of a UK-based company in the security sector had breached the human rights provisions of the Guidelines in Cuba. More specifically the NGO alleged that the company had contracted with the US Navy to provide support services to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and that taking the contract is inconsistent with human rights obligations under the OECD Guidelines, as well as with the parent company’s own human rights policy."
"Security sector issues in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0045.htm,"The NGO wanted the company to cease to provide services under the contract, and also to provide the NGO with details of the contract, details of its policies, and due diligence relating to this and any similar contracts supporting US counter-terror operations, including any measures to mitigate adverse human rights impacts."
"Security sector issues in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0045.htm,"The NCP undertook and initial assessment, during the course of which it contacted the company who accepted the invitation to respond to the allegations. The company denied the allegations and noted that its influence over the subsidiary’s decisions was limited by US Government foreign ownership and control procedures applying to companies that may access classified information or undertake classified tasks. The company also noted that it was divesting itself of the subsidiary, and has subsequently confirmed that the subsidiary has been divested."
"Security sector issues in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0045.htm,After conducting its initial assessment the UK NCP concluded that the specific instance did not merit further consideration by the UK NCP and recommended that the NGO submit their request to the US NCP. This conclusion does not mean that the UK NCP is making any finding about whether the issues raised are material and substantiated.

S.A., had breached the employment and industrial relations, and human rights provisions of the Guidelines with their operations in Peru. In addition to requesting intervention by the Chilean NCP, the trade unions had also approached the Colombian and the Peruvian NCPs. The Chilean NCP offered its good offices to the parties, but Ripley Corp. S.A. declined the offer due to ongoing legal proceedings and collective negotiations with the corresponding union in Peru."
Retail sector in Peru,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/cl0009.htm,The Chilean NCP requested additional information from the Peruvian NCP regarding the alleged ongoing legal proceedings and collective negotiations.

To help this assessment, the NCP requested inputs on the matter raised from one of its focal points in the Chilean Ministry of Environment.

Human rights issues in Papua New Guinea,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0007.htm,The NCP has undertaken an initial assessment of the specific instance and concluded that it is not appropriate for the NCP to analyse the NGOs request further. These reasons are outlined in the NCP's final statement and reproduced below.

Human rights issues in Papua New Guinea,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0007.htm,"In reaching this conclusion, the ANCP considered the three aspects to the NGO's submission:"
Human rights issues in Papua New Guinea,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0007.htm,"The role of G4S in giving effect to Government policy.The ANCP considers that aspects of the complaint could be interpreted as commentary on government policy. However, G4S as service provider is not accountable for government policy and other mechanisms exist for review and scrutiny of policy. The ANCP is not the most appropriate vehicle for resolution of such matters. It is not the role of the ANCP to issue commentary, whether intended or otherwise, on government policies or law."
Human rights issues in Papua New Guinea,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0007.htm,"The conduct of G4S staff in delivering on the contract with the Government.The conduct of G4S staff is relevant to the OECD guidelines. In this regard, the ANCP notes the reviews that have already taken place in respect of the MRPC, which have reviewed the conduct of G4S staff:"

View report: Incident at the Manus Island Detention Centre from 16 February to 18 February 2014."
Human rights issues in Papua New Guinea,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0007.htm,"The ANCP is of the view that a further review of G4S conduct at the MRPC would be unlikely to add further value to these already extensive reviews. As G4S has not operated the facility since March 2014, there is unlikely to be any new information that can be brought to light on its operation of the MRPC."

As part of this process, the NCP offered the parties the chance to hold joint mediation meetings. This was accepted by the trade union. However, in a letter dated 20 November 2014 the company stated that it would not accept the NCP’s offer. The company believed that the trade union's request was part of an international campaign, and in their opinion it had not been made in good faith. Furthermore, the company believe that the complaint was unfounded and the OECD Guidelines had not been violated."
Labour conditions in the automobile sector in Germany,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0020.htm,"The NCP greatly regrets the rejection of its offer of mediation by the company because, in its view, the offer of mediation talks contributes towards improving the relations between employee representatives, active trade union members and the management. Mediation would have given the parties a foundation for constructive and trusting co-operation without the need for further court cases.The NCP suggests that the company makes efforts to clear the matters up internally and that account should be taken of the OECD Guidelines in this process. Full details of the NCP's decision and process are given in their final statement, issued upon conclusion of the specific instance."

Alleged human rights violations via satellite services provided to US,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0023.htm,"Due to the fact that the company was incorporated in Luxembourg and its main operations centre for satellite operations is located in the US, any issues relating to general due diligence would therefore have to be dealt from there. No assertion has been made that the company’s actions have had any adverse impacts in Germany and no sufficient assertion exists that the company itself conducts related activities in Germany.On these grounds the NCP has not accepted to consider this specific instance further and issued a final statement concluding the specific instance.

Interference with striking workers in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0010.htm,"The NCP accepted the specific instance for further consideration and requested further information from both parties. The bank replied that their use of the ""Interdito Proibitório"", which was within their constitutional rights, did not constitute anti-union behaviour. The trade union disagreed saying that ""Interdito Proibitório"" was a legal loophole and citing the bank's alleged plans to involved the police to scatter protesters in order to break up the strikes should they have gone ahead."

Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,Read the final statement issued by the French NCP concluding the specific instance - 25 March 2015 | français
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"In September 2014 the French NCP received a request for review from a Cameroonian individual alleging that the French Development Agency (AFD) had breached the general provisions of the Guidelines through its financing investments in the company AES Sonel (now named ENEO), in Cameroon."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,More specifically he:
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"The request concerned an individual labour dispute, a general criticism of AES Sonel’s governance and the lack of due diligence of its business partners (the mother company and financial institutions)."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"The issues raised in the specific instance had also been the subject of a number of judicial proceedings in Cameroon notably the decision of the Supreme Court in December 2012 condemning AES Sonel for its decision in 2002 regarding the individual. Other judicial processes were still ongoing at the time of the individual's request to the French NCP. Moreover, the individual had submitted related cases to several international non-judicial grievance mechanisms, questioning AES SONEL’s business relationships who financed the company's investment plan in 2005/2006, these being: the UK NCP, who transmitted the specific instance to the US NCP*; the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman of the World Bank Group; the EIB; the French Agency for Development; and finally the French NCP."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,The French NCP acknowledged receipt request in October 2014 however it found that the admissibility was tenuous for several reasons:
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"During the initial assessment process, the French NCP consulted with the US and UK NCPs, took note of the World Bank’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman’s decisions and analysed the judicial proceedings conducted in Cameroon. The NCP wished to meet with the AFD Group to discuss its due diligence toward AES Sonel to finalise its initial assessment and informed the individual of this. The meeting with AFD took place in January 2015 and the NCP subsequently finalised its initial assessment, concluding that the specific instance did not merit further consideration."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"The NCP noted that none of the aspects of the case were admissible. Firstly, the labour dispute between the plaintiff and AES Sonel should be dealt with by local judicial authorities. This dispute goes beyond the scope of the French NCP (AES Sonel’s mother company was American and AFD was not in a business relation with AES Sonel at that time). Secondly, the plaintiff did not provide substantial evidence to support the accusations regarding AES Sonel's governance and human resources management."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"However, the NCP decided to examined the AFD Group due diligence around two issues. Firstly, AFD Group’s due diligence toward AES Sonel in order to identify social risks and promote good governance. Secondly, AFD’s due diligence measures to ensure that its partner (AES Sonel – ENEO) respected judicial decision in order to obtain a sustainable treatment of this peculiar labour dispute. "
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"The NCP noted AFD had assumed its responsibilities and performed the appropriate due diligence vis-à-vis ENEO as recommended by the OECD Guidelines and thanks the Agency for its transparency and cooperation. The NCP encouraged AFD to make sure that this labour dispute would be settled in accordance with national judicial decisions. It also recommended that the AFD Group and its partners launch a social and governance audit of ENEO based upon OECD principals for responsible business conduct. With these recommendations, the NCP concluded the specific instance as it was not useful to offer its good offices to the parties."
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,In March 2015 the NCP concluded the specific instance and issued its final statement after consultation with the parties and the UK and US NCPs.
Violation of employee rights in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0020.htm,"* In August 2011, the individual first submitted his case to the UK NCP as AES Siroco, the mother company of AES SONEL was based in the UK. The UK NCP decided to transfer the case to the US NCP as AES Siroco was a subsidiary of AES, a multinational company based in the US. The US NCP undertook an initial assessment in September 2012 and concluded that the request lacked sufficient substantiation of racially discriminatory practices. The individual contested the transfer of his request by the UK NCP to the US NCP and submitted his request again to the UK NCP who rejected it, as it considered the request to be identical to the original submission in 2011."

The NGOs had asked NBIM to contact the companies with a view to getting them to stop their alleged undesirable activities which were stated to include violations of labour rights in their Uzbekistan subsidiaries. "
Due diligence in the financial sector in Norway,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0013.htm,"The request to the NCP concerned NBIM’s handling, investigations and follow-up of the alleged violations.

Due diligence in the financial sector in Norway,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0012.htm,"In November 2014, the Norwegian NCP received a request for review from the trade unions United Steel Workers (USW) and Birlesik Metal IS alleging that US company Crown Holdings Inc. and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) had breached the human rights provisions of the Guidelines."
Due diligence in the financial sector in Norway,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0012.htm,"The allegations were  based on the assumption that Crown Holdings, domiciled in the USA, had not complied with the OECD Guidelines. The trade unions had asked NBIM to contact the company with a view to getting it to stop its alleged undesirable activities, which were stated to include violations of labour rights in its Canadian and Turkish subsidiaries."
Due diligence in the financial sector in Norway,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0012.htm,"The request raised questions about what type of due diligence can be expected of a minority shareholder, and questions of principle concerning application of the Guidelines in relation to financial institutions."

Alleged human rights violations via communication technologies provided to US,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0024.htm,Read the final statement issued by the German NCP concluding the specific instance - 13 July 2015
Alleged human rights violations via communication technologies provided to US,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0024.htm,"In March 2015 the German NCP received a request for review from an NGO alleging that a multinational enterprise had breached the human rights provisions of the Guidelines. More specifically the allegations related to a teaming agreement concluded between the German communications technology company and a US company which enables the use of communication technology in drones provided by the US-company. The NGO claims that these drones have been used by US armed forces for operations including in some countries on which no war had been declared, specifically in Yemen."
Alleged human rights violations via communication technologies provided to US,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0024.htm,"After undertaking an initial assessment, the NCP concluded that it cannot consider the specific human rights violations because the drone attacks in question took place between 2012 and 2013 which dates to before the time the company concluded its agreement with the US company. And, while the company´s website does not make any reference to responsibility for protecting human rights, the NCP is of the opinion that the company has adequately demonstrated in its correspondence with the NCP, that it fulfils its due diligence requirements in accordance with the requirements of the Guidelines. Furthermore the company has credibly demonstrated that the radio transmitters covered by the agreement with the US company are unable to navigate drones, particularly over large distances."
Alleged human rights violations via communication technologies provided to US,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/de0024.htm,"On these grounds the NCP has not accepted to consider this specific instance further and issued a final statement concluding the specific instance. As the specific instance did not proceed beyond the initial assessment stage, the names of the parties have not been made public."
Extractive sector in France,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0007.htm,In March 2003 the French NCP received a request for review from a trade union alleging that a multinational enterprise had breached the employment and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines in the extractive sector in France.
Extractive sector in France,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0007.htm,The NCP evaluated the request and concluded that it did not merit further consideration as it didn't touch directly on the OECD Guidelines. The NCP also decided that it was not appropriate to interfere with the parallel proceedings pending before the French Labour Court (Prud'hommes).

Intimidation and bribery in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0036.htm,"In June 2013 the US NCP received a request for review from the NGOs Center for Environment and Development (CED) and Network to Fight against Hunger (RELUFA) alleging that Herakles Farms' affiliate SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon (SGSOC) had breached the combating bribery provisions of the Guidelines in Cameroon. More specifically the NGOs alleged that there had been cases of intimidation and bribery of community leaders, government officials, and local citizens by SGSOC officials to gain land for their operations. The NGOs maintained that the company should address those allegations either by publicly denying them or by investigating them, and requested that SGSOC create policies and procedures to regularly consult with the community members and members of civil society."
Intimidation and bribery in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0036.htm,After undertaking an initial assessment the NCP accepted the specific instance for further consideration and offered its confidential mediation services to assist the parties in seeking a mutually agreeable resolution to the issues raised.
Intimidation and bribery in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0036.htm,"The offer of mediation was accepted by all parties. The mediation sessions facilitated by the U.S. Federal Mediation Conciliation Service (FMCS) started in 2014 with separate telephonic sessions culminating in final joint sessions held on June 16-17, 2015. The mediation successfully concluded with a mutually agreed upon resolution signed by all parties (see annex 2 of the NCP's final statement). Given this successful mediated outcome, the US NCP concluded the specific instance."

Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,The Norwegian NCP received a request for review from Norwegian Climate Network and Concerned Scientists Norway alleging that Statoil ASA was breaching the environment provisions of the Guidelines due to its oil sands operations contributing to Canada’s violation of its international obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during 2008-2012.
Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,The Norwegian and Canadian NCPs agreed that the Norwegian NCP would be the lead NCP for this specific instance however they consulted with the Canadian NCP on the initial assessment.
Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,"The Norwegian NCP Norway decided to reject the case on formal grounds, while underscoring the challenges that oil sands operations may pose to the climate and the environment."
Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,"NCP Norway's initial assessment concluded that the request, while concerning some of today’s most pressing issues, was directed towards Canada’s policy of allowing oil sands development rather than towards the manner in which Statoil has operated in the context of this policy."
Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,The request did not therefore meet the criteria specified in the OECD Procedural Guidelines or fall clearly within the scope of the Guidelines and could not be accepted for further consideration.
Oil sands extraction in Canada,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0008.htm,"In highlighting the risks associated with oil sands development, the NCP called particular attention to valid concerns about the current monitoring regime, that land reclamation is not keeping pace with land disturbance, as well as the long-term and cumulative regional effects on groundwater and air quality. All parties co-operated and engaged positively in the NCP process by readily providing information and comments to the NCP. The NCP offered its good offices by holding a meeting with the NGOs in August 2011 and by offering them the opportunity to further provide further information regarding their allegations in December 2011. The NGOs did not wish to heed this request."

After two mediation meetings and the NGOs and Van Oord requested a meeting with the Port of Suape - Complexo Industrial Portuário Eraldo Gueiros - to propose that they should participate and share the costs of repair with Van Oord. After an unsuccessful attempt to meet with the Port of Suape, the two parties initiated a private mediation process and requested the Brazilian NCP to suspend the processing of the specific instance until the parties reported on the outcome of the private mediation."

Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"In May 2015, the Swiss NCP received a submission from Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI) regarding alleged human rights violations of migrant workers by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) related to the construction of facilities for the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar."
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"More specifically, the submitter alleged that FIFA did not observe the OECD Guidelines by appointing Qatar as the host state for the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar in 2010. According to the submitter, at this time the human rights violations of migrant workers in Qatar were widely documented. While FIFA’s Bidding Agreement for the FIFA 2022 World Cup required Qatar to provide information under twenty different chapters, including “Sustainable Social and Human Development”, there was no requirement to address human or labour rights."
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"The submitting party further stated that after appointing Qatar as the host state, the responding party failed to conduct adequate and ongoing human rights due diligence as called for in the updated OECD Guidelines which entered into force in 2011. In the view of the submitting party, the responding party should have taken adequate and ongoing steps to identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse human rights impacts."
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"On 27 July 2015, the responding party submitted a written statement to the Swiss NCP concerning the issues raised in this specific instance."
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"In its initial assessment, the Swiss NCP accepted the submission for further consideration. This should not be construed as a judgment of whether or not the corporate behaviour or actions in question were consistent with observance of the OECD Guidelines and should not be equated with a determination on the merits of the issues raised in the submission.  "
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,"The parties accepted the offer of the Swiss NCP to conduct a mediation. Between January and December 2016, six mediation meetings took place at the premises of the Swiss NCP in Berne. The mediation led to mutually agreed solutions. Both parties agreed to disclose the outcome of the mediations in the final statement issued by the NCP on 2 May 2017."
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and Wood Workers’ International (BWI),http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0013.htm,Both parties engaged throughout the entire mediation process in a very constructive manner. They demonstrated a firm willingness throughout the process to find a mutually satisfying resolution of the issues raised in the submission.The NCP will follow up on the implementation of the agreed joint outcome based on progress reports from parties and a planned follow up meeting.
Alleged wrongful dismissal of employee in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/it0007.htm,Read the initial assessment issued by the Italian NCP – 3 August 2015
Alleged wrongful dismissal of employee in Brazil,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/it0007.htm,"On 17 June 2015 the Italian NCP received a request for review from an individual alleging that he had been wrongfully dismissed by Agip do Brasil which was part of the ENI Group at the time of the dismissal. The individual had previously been working at the company in Brazil as a manager.   On 2 July 2015, the NCP requested further information from the notifier regarding relevant sections of the Guidelines. The NCP noted that reference should be made to the Guidelines prior to the 2011 update. However, the notifier stated that developments had occurred in recent times and referred instead to the 2011 version. On 2 July the Italian NCP informed ENI S.p.A. of the request and on 9 July 2015, ENI S.p.A. submitted a note to the Italian NCP concerning the issues raised in this specific instance. On 15 July 2015 the Italian NCP contacted the Brazilian NCP for assistance because in June 2013 this request was submitted to the Brazilian NCP which rejected it since it did not meet the Brazilian NCP’s criteria for admissibility. The Italian NCP received the information requested from the Brazilian NCP on 23 July 2015.   The initial assessment of the Italian NCP dated 3 August 2015 notes that the issue submitted refers to facts dating back to 2001 and that it was settled by national courts in Brazil in 2004 and rejected by the Brazilian NCP in 2013. As such, the Italian NCP found that there was no room for mediation between the parties or any positive contribution to be given to the resolution of issues raised. Consequently, the Italian NCP finds that the request submitted does not merit further examination. "

"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"Mr. Bart Stapert is an attorney with expertise in the defense of capital punishment cases. In the submission he alleges that Mylan’s failure to restrict the sale of its products to prisons in the United States risks enabling the execution of prisoners using rocuronium bromide in violation of their right to life and, potentially, their right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The submission refers to alleged non-observance of the General Policies chapter and the commentary on Human Rights in the Guidelines."
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"In the view of Mr. Bart Stapert, Mylan should acknowledge the risk that without distribution controls in place its medicines may be purchased by prisons in the United States and used to execute prisoners, investigate what distribution controls it may impose, take swift action to implement comprehensive distribution controls, try to prevent the use of any Mylan medicines which may already have been sold to prisons and publish a policy statement confirming Mylan’s commitment to human rights, in particular to the human rights abuses associated with the use of medicines in lethal injection executions."
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"On 21 April 2015, Mylan submitted an initial response following the submission by Mr. Bart Stapert concerning the issues raised in this specific instance. The company states that it has never delivered, marketed or distributed rocuronium bromide for use in lethal executions, nor received or filed an order from any prison or other entity for use of the medicine in connection with a lethal injection. The company also challenged the jurisdiction of the Dutch NCP stating that the submission ought to be heard by the US NCP. Furthermore, the company contends that the demanded measures to be taken are beyond its control and that the issue is more one of ethical and public policy debate."
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"The initial assessment of the Dutch NCP concluded that the issues raised merited further consideration and the Dutch NCP therefore accepted the specific instance and offered its good offices to both parties. The Dutch NCP noted that, although in principle a notification should have been filed at the NCP where the alleged problems were occurring (in this instance the United States), the NCP has consulted with the US NCP and agreed that the Dutch NCP will handle this specific instance to affect change at the highest corporate entity in the Netherlands. "
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,Both parties accepted the NCP’s offer to engage in mediation and met in November 2015 to start a dialogue facilitated by the NCP aimed at resolving the issue at hand. The parties agreed to continue a constructive dialogue after the meeting. The NCP has made some recommendations in addition to the due diligence recommendations in the Guidelines and closed the specific instance on 11 April 2016 by publishing a final statement.
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"The NCP is of the opinion that distributors and purchasers of, in this case, medicines distributed or purchased for purposes that are inconsistent with approved labelling and applicable medical standards of care fall under a business relationship. The NCP concludes that the Guidelines are applicable to both the supply chain and the distribution chain."
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,"The NCP encourages pharmaceutical companies to work with different stakeholders such as distributors, human rights organisations and others to prevent rocuronium bromide and other medicines being used in lethal injections and suggests that Mylan shares the outcome of this matter and its due diligence steps with other companies in the sector."
"Mylan N.V. and an individual, Mr. Bart Stapert",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nl0025.htm,The NCP conducted an evaluation to assess the outcomes of the mediation in September 2017 and found that the agreement had been fully implemented.

The NGO asked whether human rights had been respected and whether due diligence was applied in the sale of these security products  to Bahrain which could have been used in 2011 and more recently to potentially violate human rights. These tear gas  products fall under a specific export regulation in France."
"Alsetex, Etienne Lacroix Group and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0021.htm,"In November 2015, the NCP published its initial assessment which noted that the submission was precise, detailed and well documented and that questions raised by the NGO merited further consideration. The NCP offered its general good offices and both parties accepted. Given the confidential nature of the sector in question, the NCP asked ADHRBC to sign a non-disclosure agreement. After this contact with the parties, the NCP offered mediation to discuss the enterprise's due diligence, which Alsetex refused."
"Alsetex, Etienne Lacroix Group and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0021.htm,"The NCP had a constructive dialogue with both parties which led to an agreement. On 4 July 2016, the NCP released a Report (final statement). The NCP notes that specific European and French regulations on the tear gas export control take into consideration human rights and the potential risks caused by the final use of such products. The NCP notes that the enterprise conducted due diligence as recommended by the Guidelines through this legal export control system. It noted that the enterprise strictly complied with French regulations and respected the export ban decided by the French government in 2011 after it was determined  that tear gas had been misused in Bahrein in February 2011. By respecting these decisions and regulations, the enterprise complied with the Guidelines and did not contribute to human rights violations in Bahrain. The NCP also noted that the enterprise has developed risk-based due diligence measures and recommends that the company formalise its risk management system. The NCP also notes that Alsetex is developing a policy for responsible business conduct, and comments this initiative. The NCP invites Alsetex to use the OECD Guidelines and to take into account comments provided by ADHRD during this process and release its policy afterwards. "

Holcim and NGO consortium,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/ch0011.htm,"According to the submitters, the designation of a compensation land related to activities of Holcim, would adversely affect 826 households, or about 3000 persons, from the village of Ringinrejo. The NGOs claim that Holcim did not undertake negotiations with the concerned population of Ringinrejo, but instead with farmers, who do not live on the compensation land but cultivate it.In its initial assessment, the Swiss NCP accepted the submission for further consideration and offered its mediation services, which the parties accepted. On 16 November 2015, decision-making representatives of both parties participated in a mediation meeting in Berne. Both parties demonstrated their willingness to seek a mutual satisfactory solution to settle the dispute and agreed in a joint outcome on concrete steps to be implemented in Indonesia.Between February 2016 and January 2017, the Swiss NCP followed the implementation of the agreed joint outcome.

The Swiss NCP expects parties to submit a written report to the Swiss NCP, which can be shared with the other party.

The NCP also asked that the company provide written updates to the NCP 3 months and 6 months after the publication of the final statement.

Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,"On 4 May 2015 the French NCP received a submission concerning a social conflict and the dismissal of 311 workers which took place in July 2005 in Mali by a local subsidiary of the French Group Bouygues Construction (“Somadex”). According to the submitters, the workers were dismissed in retaliation for striking. The submission was made by a group of 255 former Somadex workers represented by M. Yacouba Traore, who is also the Secretary General of a Trade Union of the mining sector in Mali (Fename)."
Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,"The first version of the submission was not admissible. The NCP proposed to the submitters to redraft it before September 2015, which was done, and deemed admissible even though the submission was not densely documented. In February 2016 the NCP finished its initial assessment and concluded that the submission did not merit further examination. Prior to reaching this assessment, the NCP set up a dialogue with the submitters and with the enterprise, Bouygues Construction Group.

Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,On 13 June 2016 the NCP published a final statement closing the specific instance after the initial assessment. Both parties were consulted in drafting the final statement.
Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,"In its decision, the NCP noted that during the incident in question, Somadex was confronted with a breakdown of social dialogue leading to a massive strike. This strike was afterwards recognised and judged illegal and dismissals for abandonment of post were judged legal. There is no evidence that this judgment was contested. Due to the seriousness of the social conflict, and the illegal actions of the workers, the enterprise and their social partners at the mine in question (Morila mine) could not maintain constructive negotiations, as recommended by the Guidelines."
Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,"The NCP also noted that while FIDH denounced the arrests and the detention of several workers engaged in the social conflict as a violation of human rights, the potential involvement of the enterprise in these incidents was not established. The NCP underlines that these actions were the responsibility of Malian authorities and that “due diligence” and “business relationship” were not concepts included in the Guidelines in 2005."
Somadex and former employees,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/fr0022.htm,"In its final statement the NCP includes a determination finding that Somadex did not violate the Guidelines (2000 version). The NCP also notes that currently the Bouygues Construction Group implements a code of ethics demonstrating lessons learnt from this incident and commits to social dialogue and vocational training for its staff notably in African regions.  The NCP recommended that the Bouygues Construction Group enrich its code of ethics by referencing the Guidelines, in particular, Chapter V which references ILO Declarations and conventions. It also recommends that the enterprise implement the recommendations of the OECD due diligence guidance for meaningful stakeholder engagement in the extractive sector in the context of its extractive operations."

JSC Norvik Bank regarding efficiency and transparency of Latvia’s legal system and public institutions,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lv0001.htm,"More specifically, JSC Norvik Bank alleged that with regard to the dispute resolution between JSC Norvik Bank and Winergy Ltd., justice is being denied via a deliberately slow and inefficient process."
JSC Norvik Bank regarding efficiency and transparency of Latvia’s legal system and public institutions,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lv0001.htm,The Latvian NCP concluded that the issues were not relevant to the implementation of the Guidelines and did not merit further consideration. The reason for the decision is that public institutions and judicial authorities mentioned in the specific instance cannot be considered multinational enterprises for the purposes of the Guidelines as they are not international in nature and are not engaged in commercial activities. Furthermore the issue being raised (denial of justice through inefficient process) is outside the scope of the recommendations of the Guidelines.
JSC Norvik Bank regarding efficiency and transparency of Latvia’s legal system and public institutions,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/lv0001.htm,"On 13 October 2016, the NCP issued closed the specific instance and issued a final statement."

"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"On 23 June 2016, European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association (collectively “the Submitters”), human rights non-governmental organisations, submitted a specific instance to the NCP alleging that the Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation (collectively “the Companies”) did not observe the Guidelines. The events addressed in the specific instance cover a period from March 2015 to the submission date. "
"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"The submitters alleged that the companies failed to take appropriate steps to ensure that their products did not cause or contribute to human rights abuses, and that the companies’ products directly contributed to adverse human rights impacts in Yemen through their use by the government of Saudi Arabia. The submitters also claimed that the companies did not have a relevant human rights policy and did not carry out appropriate human rights due diligence in the sale of their products. "
"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"After thorough review of information provided, the NCP decided not to offer mediation, noting that the purpose of the Guidelines is to promote responsible business conduct by multinational enterprises. The specific instance concerned the conduct of particular States, and would have entailed an examination of state conduct, which would not serve to advance the Guidelines.  "
"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"More specifically, the NCP noted that this specific instance is inextricably intertwined with the practices of specific states, including Saudi Arabia and the United States.  Arms sales to Saudi Arabia were completed through two processes:  transfers completed by the U.S. government through the FMS program and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) in which the exports were approved by the U.S. government.  All arms transfer decisions are reviewed and approved under the criteria outlined in the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy as detailed in Presidential Policy Directive 27 (PPD-27, January 15, 2014).  Under PPD-27, the criteria considered includes the “likelihood that the recipient would use the arms to commit human rights abuses or serious violations of international humanitarian law, retransfer the arms to those who would commit human rights abuses or serious violations of international humanitarian law"". Additionally, for DCS cases, the State Department considers, pursuant to section 38(a)(2) of the AECA, among other factors, whether the sale would “increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict” or “support international terrorism"". The decision to use arms procured from the United States or these companies is a decision made by Saudi Arabia in its capacity as a sovereign state. However, the use must be consistent with the provisions of the agreement, or license, that was the basis for the sale or approval of the transfer. "
"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"Accordingly, this specific instance concerns various state practices, which NCPs are not designed to assess. "
"The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation and European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR), Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/us0045.htm,"This led the NCP to close the specific instance on 18 November 2016. In its final statement, the NCP encouraged all U.S. companies in every sector to carry out human rights due diligence and avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts, and to consider referencing the OECD Guidelines in company human rights commitments. The NCP also noted that the U.S. government regularly engages with civil society and other stakeholders regarding any concerns with U.S. policy, including on the issues raised in the specific instance, and is available to discuss the issues further with the submitters.  "

Alleged human rights impacts by a Brazilian multinational in Bahrain,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0024.htm,"More specifically, the NGO alleged that the company did not observe the Guidelines by providing tear gas to Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The submission stated that the company's product was used in violation of human rights and that the company did not make it clear whether or not it had engaged in adequate human rights due diligence processes."
Alleged human rights impacts by a Brazilian multinational in Bahrain,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0024.htm,"In a preliminary analysis, the NCP concluded that the specific instance did not meet the acceptance criteria in the initial assessment phase. The multinational provides non-lethal products to various countries and United Nations peacekeeping forces. There is no evidence that the use of its products has caused human rights abuses per se. The company complies with Brazilian laws, although it does not have a specific human rights policy."
Alleged human rights impacts by a Brazilian multinational in Bahrain,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0024.htm,"The Brazilian NCP found that the issue did not merit further examination, in accordance with paragraph 25 of the Implementation Guidelines, since the claimant substantiated the demand using a news item from a journalist's blog and therefore the claim was not material and substantiated."
Alleged human rights impacts by a Brazilian multinational in Bahrain,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/br0024.htm,"For the reasons set out above, the Brazilian NCP did not accept the specific instance."

The submission referred to a UK investment company that in 2014 acquired a majority shareholding in the employer company in Cameroon. The submission alleged that the UK investment company failed to improve the poor governance practices of the energy company, referring to alleged unjustified and arbitrary changes to the position and salary of the submitter, and the falsification or withholding of employment records."
Disclosure issue involving a UK investment company holding shares in an energy company in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0048.htm,"The NCP invited the UK investment company to respond. The company noted that it does not have any role in day to day management of the submitter’s employer, but that on acquiring its shareholding, it made some changes to personnel and policies of this company to strengthen its corporate governance. It also noted that most events referred to in the submission occurred before its shareholding, and that the submitter’s employment dispute had been addressed through the proper process and the compensation legally due to him has been paid."
Disclosure issue involving a UK investment company holding shares in an energy company in Cameroon,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/uk0048.htm,"The UK NCP did not accept the specific instance for further examination.

Bayswater Contracting and Mining Group (BCM) and the National Federation of Mining and Energy (FENAME) of Mali,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0008.htm,"More specifically, FENAME alleged that BCM, at their operating site in Loulo, Mali, dismissed 436 workers including 26 union representatives without correct approval from the relevant local Government agency - the Mali Directorate of Labour."
Bayswater Contracting and Mining Group (BCM) and the National Federation of Mining and Energy (FENAME) of Mali,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/au0008.htm,The NCP conducted an initial investigation and determined that BCM is not a registered Australian enterprise.

Communities Action Network (WeCAN)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nz0005.htm,"On 15 June 2015 two individuals, through their representative NGO Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network (WeCAN), filed a specific instance alleging breaches of their human rights by Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited (Southern Response) and New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited (NZPT). More specifically, the submission alleged  long delays, disputes over assessments and unnecessary complications in managing claims made after the 2010/11 Canterbury earthquake sequence had breached their rights to health, property, adequate housing and the rights of children and persons with disabilities."
"Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited (Southern Response), New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited (NZPT) and individuals represented by the NGO Wider Earthquake

AMI was a local Mutual insurance company, owned by policyholders through the AMI Member Trust, which operated only within New Zealand. Large losses after the earthquakes eventually saw the restructuring and sale of the company, and the Government taking on responsibility for managing AMI’s existing Canterbury earthquake claims as Southern Response. The rest of the business was bought by the Insurance Australia Group (IAG)."
"Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited (Southern Response), New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited (NZPT) and individuals represented by the NGO Wider Earthquake
Communities Action Network (WeCAN)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nz0005.htm,"The submitters argued that despite being owned by Government, Southern Response undertakes commercial activities through its management of the AMI claims, and its use of AMI’s available reinsurance cover and international reinsurance generally, establishes the international link required to bring it within the scope of the Guidelines. The submitters also alleged that NZPT had a linked business relationship with AMI and Southern Response because of their then role as trustee for the AMI Member Trust, AMI’s activities requiring international reinsurance, and because in undertaking its business as a professional trustee, NZPT is itself engaged in numerous international investment activities. "

"Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited (Southern Response), New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited (NZPT) and individuals represented by the NGO Wider Earthquake
Communities Action Network (WeCAN)",http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/nz0005.htm,"Southern Response is entirely owned by the New Zealand Government, and only operates in New Zealand.  It does not compete in the insurance market, has a purely domestic operation, and does not have a transnational focus.  In terms of reinsurance, obtaining goods or services from overseas does not, in itself, make an entity an MNE.   NZPT is a registered New Zealand company. It operates in New Zealand and is wholly owned by Public Trust (a government entity). NZPT’s engagement with AMP’s Superannuation Master Trust did not make it an MNE, nor could AMI’s reinsurance activities sensibly make the NZPT an MNE.   "

The Norwegian oil and gas operator DNO ASA versus the trade union Industri Energi,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0014.htm,Read the initial assessment issued by the Norwegian NCP - 2 May 2017
The Norwegian oil and gas operator DNO ASA versus the trade union Industri Energi,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0014.htm,"On 8 November 2016, the Norwegian trade union Industri Energi filed a complaint against the Norwegian company DNO ASA (hereinafter referred to as ‘DNO’) under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Guidelines’). On 7 April 2017, the Norwegian National Contact Point (NCP) decided to accept the complaint for consideration. On 10 May 2017, the parties accepted the offer of mediation, which took place over four days during the period 17 August to 16 October 2017. The mediation was unsuccessful and was concluded on 16 October 2017. The parties have subsequently submitted their final comments."
The Norwegian oil and gas operator DNO ASA versus the trade union Industri Energi,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0014.htm,"The complaint from Industri Energi was submitted on behalf of the Yemeni trade union DNO Yemen Union. The key issue in the complaint concerned lack of notification and consultation between DNO and the employee representatives in Yemen in connection with collective dismissals and suspension of production in the war-like situation that prevailed in 2015. It is claimed that the Yemeni trade union wanted to engage in dialogue with DNO’s representatives in Yemen on the dismissals and suspension of production, without this request being granted. The complaint also concerned the question of whether DNO obstructed the workers’ right to organise and collective bargaining in Yemen, and the validity of dismissals as part of the downsizing process."
The Norwegian oil and gas operator DNO ASA versus the trade union Industri Energi,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0014.htm,"DNO argues that the key issue in the complaint is the question concerning the validity of the dismissals as part of the downsizing process in Yemen. This issue was the subject of a dispute case in the country. DNO claims that the aim of the complaint is to contest the lawfulness of the downsizing in Yemen in 2015 and that the ongoing court case before Yemeni courts meant that the matter should not have been considered by the Norwegian NCP. Furthermore, DNO claims that the state of emergency in Yemen meant that the company could refrain from notifying and consulting the employee representatives in connection with the dismissals."
The Norwegian oil and gas operator DNO ASA versus the trade union Industri Energi,http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/instances/no0014.htm,"Since the mediation was concluded without results, the NCP has considered the complaint and arrived at the following conclusion: DNO has not complied with paragraphs 6 and 8 in Chapter V of the Guidelines on notification and consultation in connection with changes in the enterprise’s operations. DNO has fulfilled the expectations on the right to join a trade union in paragraphs 1a) and 1b) of Chapter V. The NCP recommends that DNO in future should carry out risk-based due diligence and enhance the transparency of its guidelines and procedures for responsible business conduct."

After the mediation, the parties agreed to implement a remediation plan over two years. The agreed remediation plan was presented to and approved by the French NCP on 3 September 2013. The French NCP also approved independent monitoring mechanisms (GRET and SNJP) to make the remediation plan operational and ensure its proper implementation. This resulted in a blockage in the implementation of the remediation plan by Bolloré’s subsidiary (Socfin Group). As a result this specific instance was  refocused on the Belgian-Luxembourg Socfin Group in which the Bolloré Group is the majority shareholder. The French NCP suggested to the Belgian NCP that it should engage with the Socfin Group in 2015 to resolve the blockage. Initially, the Socfin Group refused the good offices of the Belgian NCP, but in December 2015 it agreed to participate in dialogue through the Belgian NCP."
