If members of Congress seo out news exposure, then the correlation between the preference-based
‘rankings and newspaper coverage may simply be an artifact of this behavior, regardless of why
certain committees receive more coverage. Although we may have good reasons to think that
press coverage focuses on more important committees, this concern reflects « general problem
in correlating existing measures with our own. As a result, in the subsequent sections, we also
investigate a variety of eases in which, rather than comparing measures, we look at observable de
jure shifts in power and link them to changes in our measute,
4.2 Congressional Party Leaders
In this subsection, we use the news coverage of Speakers of the U.S. House to validate our power
measure for political actors. Political leaders not are randomly selected from the pool of legislators.
Presumably leaders ate selected because of their skills and qualities, and these in turn probably
Lelp them attract media attention. A simple comparison of the news coverage of lenders and rank
and-file legislators would pick up many systematic differences between the two groups that are not
necessarily reflecting their power
Instond wo use a simple within-leislator design to validate our power measure. We focus on
‘the group of legislators who serve as party leaders at some point in their career, and compare how
‘they are covered in the newspapers before, during and after the period in which they are in power.
If news coverage is a good measure of power, we would expect to see a substantial increase in the
coverage of individual members of Congress in the periods during which they serve as party leaders.
‘To implement this test, we search our newspaper database for the surnames of Speakers of the
House and minority-party leaders from 1877-1977, and count how often they are covered in the
news before, during and after their leadership term. To reduce the number of false positives, we
‘only count eases in which the word stem “congress” appear within a window of 5 words from the
surname, as woll as eases in which one of the words “representative,” “rep.\", shon.\", speaker,” or
eadet” appears immediately before the surname, and cases in which either of the party identifiers

Speaker of the House in our datasot reecives before becoming Speaker, while serving as Speaker,

figure shows, almost all members see a mavked increase in coverage while they are Speaker
‘To examine the pattern more systematically, we count the aumber of hits for all Speakers and
tminority-party leaders during the period 1877-1977. In Table 1, we report the average yearly number
of hits five vears before, during and five years after the leadership period.** Two things are worth
noting. First similar to the results presented in Figure 2, Panel A shows that on average the news
‘coverage of members of Congress increases by au order of magnitude when they serve as Speakers.
Second, we see a similar pattern for minority-party leaders! When a member of Congress is
appointed to leader of the minority party, the member roccives more coverage in the newspapers.
However, the media boost for minority-party leaders is not quite as big as the boost enjoyed by
Speakers. ‘This diference probably releets that Speakers are more powerful than minority-party
leaders. Overall, the results presented in Table 1 further supports the idea that power is reflected
in the newspaper coverage,

4.3 Strong vs. Weak Mayors
We now turn to the analysis of “strong” vs. “weak” mayors. ‘Traditionally, cites in the US,
‘operated under the mayor-councl form of government. In this form the mayor and city council are
separately elected offices, and the mayor is the head of the executive branch, with broad powers to
‘appoint and dismiss department heads, prepare and adusinister the city budget, and so on, This is
the “strong mayor” form, Beginning in the early 20th century and continuing throngh today, many
cities switehed to the council-manager form of government. In this form the city council is the
‘only directly elected body, and it appoints a city manager to oversee the operation of the executive
branch, ‘The mayor may be separately elected or selected by the city council from from within its
ranks, but has little of no executive authority, Some directly elected mayors have veto power, and
some mayors have agenda-setting power inside the ity council, but in many council-manager cities
8
"
"7"	"the position is largely ceremonial! According to the Municipal Year Book; in 1984 about 5456
of cities with populations over 2,500 operated under the mayor-conneil form of government and
about 35% operated under the eouneil-manager form?

For this analysis we study newspaper coverage of thee local ofices: mayor, city count, and city
manager. For each newspaper i we collect the total number of mentions ofeach of these ofies in
cach year £1 Denote these by Mayor, Council aud Manager, respectively. We then construct
throe variables

Mayor
Relative Coverage of Maser = Tiree Cig Manager , + City Coumeli,”
tive Coverage of City Manager = Coty Manager, _
Relative Coverage of Cty Manoaers = Tie City Manager, + Oly Cownely”
fs _ City Counesle
Felative Coverage of Cty Counc = Tio Cay Manager + Cy Cowal,
Since the position of city manager position does not even exist in a ety prior to the adoption of
‘ councibmanager form of goversment, coverage of this office may “automatically” increase. (Of
course, if the postion has ite actual power, then coverage might not increase, oF might increase
conly slightly. For example, minor bureaucratic positions in national, state, and local governments
are constantly be ereated and eliminated and these changes are not reflected in newspaper coverage
‘because they are too unimportant to be covered.) We therefore also construct a fourth variable
‘that only compares the coverage of the mayor and the eity council, hoth of which exist before and
after the reform:
_ Mayor
Relative Coverage of Mayor os. Counely = 5y—— err

We alo identify the year in which the home city of each newspaper switched its form of gov-
crument from the strong mayor (mayor-couneil) form to the weak mayor (eouncl-manager) form.

‘The Massachusetts Governor's Council, also known as the Executive Council is composed of eight
individuals elected from districts (plus the Lieutenant Governor who serves ex officio). ‘The eight
councillor are elected from their respective distrits every two years.

In 1964, Massachusetts voters passed ballot question that stripped the Pxecutive Counel of its
statutory powers (the changes went into effect on December 3, 1964). ‘The reform followed a scandal
in the late 19508 and early 1960s involving the sal of judicial positions; five members of the conti
‘were eventually indicted on bribery and corruption charges. Prior to this, the governor needed to
obtain the Counel’s approval for almost all gubernatorial appointments, all highway and waterway
contracts, all land-taking by eminent domain, all state leases and rentals, to determine which banks
could hold state funds in deposit, and to determine which out-of-state insurance companies could
‘operate in the state, Starting in December 1964, the governor did not need Council approval for
‘these actions. ‘The main powers left to the Exocutive Couneil were its constitutionally mandated
powers, most prominently the power to confirm judicial appointments and pardons

Most observers viewed the reform as a significant shift in power from the Executive Couneil
to the governor's office. One journalist wrote: “stripping the council of all its statutory powers.

government.” Another noted that the next governor will have “more power than any since those

"12"	"1 Introduction

At its core, politcal science isthe study of power. But empirical work on this fundamental subject
is hampered by the fact that actually observing power is difiult. In this paper, we propose using
newspaper coverage to address this obstacle. We intraduce a dataset containing ueatly 50 million
Ihistorical newspaper pages from approximately 2,700 local U.S. newspapers distributed across a
‘thousand counties over the years 1877-1977, and we uso it to develop a newspaper-based measure
cof power, After laying out the measure, we validate it through a series of analyses that leverage
historical reforms and other temporal and spatial changes in power across a wide range of political
offices, including mayors, governors, members of Congress, and the presideney. ‘The result of these
analyses is a plansible indicator of political power that applies to politcal actors and political offices
‘over wide time period and across many contexts,

‘Our idea can be captured with a simple thought experiment. First (if you live in the U.S.), ask
youself: How many official state or local party leaders can I name? How many do I ead about
regularly in the newspaper? In all likelihood, the answer to both ofthese questions is “zero.” Why?
Because these positions are not powerful that is, they do not play much of a role in contemporary
U.S. polities. Now imagine you wore a voter in late 1800s rather than the early 2000s, asking the
same questions. Ifyou lived in New York it s likely that you would have read about leaders suc as
Roscoe Conkling, Thomas C. Platt, John Kelly or Richard Croker. Similarly it is likely that you
‘would have read about Simon Cameron or Matthew Quay if you lived in Pennsylvania, Zachariah
‘Chandler if you lived in Michigan, John “Black Jack” Logan if you lived in linois, or Oliver P.
Morton if you lived in Indiana. Why? Because these people mattered. ‘They wore porwerfl bosses
‘who controlled scoess to many elected and appointed politcal offices in their states, and also had
4 siquficant impact on which laws were passed and which were defeated, both nationally and at
home. As a result, they appeared regularly in newspaper stories.

We are not the first to see this link between newspaper coverage and power. Although me-
dia coverage stems from many sources including the inevitable biases of newspapers themselves
(Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010; Graseclose and Milyo 2005; Puglisi and Snyder 2011; Larcinese,
Puglisi and Snyder 2007), as well as the demands of readership (Mullainathan and Shleifer 200;
Gontzkow and Shapiro 2006) previous scholars have observed that media coverage is positively

4.5 The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act

In 1034 Congress passed and President Roosevelt signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act

other nations. ‘These agreements could increase a decrease import duties by up to 50 percent,
and didnot require congressional appro

‘There is widespread agreement that this act represented a substantial transfer of power over
tasif policy, from Congress to the President. For example, Haggard (1988: 112) writes that jn
passing the RTA “the most important sues at stake in 1954 were institutional, centering om the
transfor of authority frm Congress to the executive.” Inwin (1098 325) writes: “From the Civil

"16"	"4.6 Summary
In this section, we have presented a varity of analyses that suggest that we can use newspaper
coverage to measure the relative power of political actors. Fist, newspaper coverage of Congres-
sional committees appears to offer an accurate view of which committees are more powerful, and
more sought after by members of Congress than others. Second, newspaper coverage of members
‘of Congress increases markedly when those members become Speaker of the House, and falls when
they stop being Speaker. Third, city government reforms that realloeate power from the mayor
to the city manager and city council appear to cause a sharp decrease in newspaper coverage of
‘mayors and a simultancous rise in the coverage ofthe newly empowered actors. Fourth, a reform to
‘the MA Exceutive Council that stripped it of many of its powers appears to produce a marked de-
«crease in newspaper coverage ofthe council. Finally, we also showed that the passage of the RTAA
‘appears to correspond with a sharp decrease in newspaper coverage of Congress in tarff-related
discussions. Taken together, these five validity tests suggest, fist, that newspaper coverage is a
‘meaningful indicator of political power and, second, that it i applicable to broad set of political
clfices and contexts
5 When Did State Party Committees Decline? A Brief Example
Application
Having validated our newspaper-based measure of power, we now offer brief example ofits value
by applying it to study the power of state and local party committees across US. history. There
is a pervading sense that these committees were once powerful but na longer ate, but it is difficult
to ldentity the precise timeframe over which this decline occurred (if, indeed, it did),

‘To measure the relative power of state and local party committees, we proceed as follows.
Fist, for each state i and year t, define Party Mentionsy as the total number of times, sumaning
cross all newspapers in the state, thatthe following occurs: the word “committee” appears after
cither the word “Democratic” or “Republican” or \"GOP\" (within 5 words), and after one of the
words “State” or “county” or “district” or “local” or “central” or ‘exceutive\" or “regular” or

“organization” (within 5 words)\" This is designed to capture all references to committees stich

(On the basis of an exhaustive reading of secondary sources, Mayhew (1986) assigns “traditional
party organization” (TPO) scores for each state on a scale from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). As he
notes, these scores are meant to capture the organizational strength “in the Inte 1960s\" (Mayhew
1986: 6). If we consider the period 1966-1970, the correlation between Party Mentions and TPO
is 0.56. If we focus just om the years 1968-1070 the correlation is even better, 0.63. This gives us
some initial confidence in applying our measure to state party organizations.

Most scholars argue that state party organizations were especially powerful in the late 19th century
For example, Reichley (1992, 120-130) notes that in the late 1800s: (3) under the leadership of
Matthew Quay, the Pennsylvania Republican state party committee received 2% of the salaries of

"20"	"6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have argued that we ean use newspaper coverage of relevant political actors as a
measure oftheir political power, under certain conditions. We have introduced a dataset of over 50
uillion historical U.S. newspaper articles, and we have validated our resulting measures of political
‘power in a vatity of ways. We have shown that newspaper coverage of political actors deereases
in times when they hold less powerful positions and increases when they hold more powerful ones,
‘and we have shown that the measure correlates well with several existing measures of particular
forms of political power

We beliove the measure has several strengths that will make it valuable for future work. Fist,
‘the measur is historically comprehensive, covering an important 1-year period of American his:
tory. This period covers all manner of reform and upheaval in the American political process,
including two world wats, the expansion of suffrage, Prohibition, the progressive reforms, Me-
Carthyism, the Voting Rights Aet, and Watergate, among many others, The study of all these
events, and many more, concerns fundamental questions about who holds power, when they hold
it, and why they are able to do so.

Second, the measure is broadly applicable; in our validity tests, we apply it to Congressional
committees, to Congressional leaders, to the president, and to local municipal governments—a set
‘that spans a variety of offices as well as individual actors. ‘Thove is no reason to think it eonld
not be extended further, to other political actors and other offices in other contexts. ‘The measure
can therefore facilitate further research in well-developed fclds (e., Congress, the bureaucracy),
and also encourage new research in contexts that have received less scholarly attention (e.g, local
government)

Of course, the measure is not without its limitations, While in many instances coverage may
indicate political power, it also results from other sourees, such as “celebrity” coverage. In many
applications this may mainly add noise to the measure, which is not overly problematic when it is
used as dependent variable in an analysis. In eases where the political actor or office in question
|uas significant personal appeal or celebrity status, however (e.g, the U.S. president) the measure
is likely to break down. Researchers who apply our measure in other contests must always take
care to validate its use and consider alternative explanations for how the measure fuetuates.

"21"	"Because power is at the core of political science, measuring it in data is an important task
for empirical researchers. The newspaper-based measure we have put forward in this paper offers
researchers a chance to study power in American polities in a variety of ways. In addition, the
arguments we have made, and the validity tests we have performed, should aid researchers in
constructing similar newspaper-based measures for other countries and other time periods, ‘Thoth
newspapers have many reasons to publish what they do, the overal fequeney with which they cover
political actors indicates who is powerful

"26"	"A. 1 Information on Dataset

In this section, we describe in detail the dataset on newspapers that we have compiled,

A. LL Summary of Data

‘The dataset consists of » stratified sample of pages printed in US. loeal newspapers initially pub-
lishod during the period 1877-1977 and later reproduced by Newspapers.com. ‘The stratification
‘works as follows. As now pages are added to the dataset, they are assigned a number based on the
newspaper ise in which they belong, We sample all pages that end with the integers 1.2, ....
7 Ab any given moment in time, we thus sample 70% ofthe existing newspaper data, but because
new data is added all the time, we cannot offer a precise percentage for future dates.

Bach page in our dataset isa string of characters and spaces extracted by Newspapers.com from
scanned copies ofthe original newspaper pages sing OCR techniques, and each page is connected
to the following meta data: name of newspaper, publication date, page number, state, county and
city of publication. In total, the dataset contains approximately 50 million unique pages from 2700
newspapers distributed across approximately a thousand counties in the US,

A. L2- Geographical Coverage
Using this metadata we count the number of pages and newspapers in each state and report this
in the map in Figure A.1. The dataset geographically covers all states, and approximately a third
of all counties appear in the dataset at some point during the studied period. The dataset roughly
rolleets the population density over the studied period. ‘The states that most frequently appear
in the dataset are PA, TX, CA, IL, OH (ranging from 3-6 million pages), whereas less populated
states such as WY, ME, RI, VT each contribute with approximately 100,000 pages. Table A.1
‘reports the exact mumnber of pages for each state.
A. LS Temporal Coverage
Using the publication dates obtained from the meta data, we count the total number of pages
published each year in the four Census regions. ‘These numbers are reported in Figure 4.2. The
sraplh illustrates that the mmber of newspaper pages increase over the frst 30-0 years, then
stagnates until the late 1940s and then rapidly grow over the rest of the studied period. ‘The
‘temporal patterns are fairly consistent across regions

It is impossible to extract lange amounts of text from old newspapers without any’ errors. Smieared
ink, pietures, poor paper quality, variation in font types, dirty scanners as well as types in the
‘original articles are among the sources of errors. Most of these errors will be random and add
noise to the word counts, To reduce this noise, we follow the common approach of using regular
expressions when we search for words. We carefully ead through a lange number of newspaper
pages and compared the OCR text with the original newspaper page. Based on this material, we
identified a number of common errors and use the regular expressions ontlined in Table A.3 to
catch these errors. Before searching in the string, we substitute all upper case characters to lower

In this section we offer follow-up analyses and robustness checks to extend the estimates presented
in the paper
A. 24 Additional Results on Mayoral Reforms
In this subsection, we perform two additional analyses on the effets of city reforms that stripped
‘the mayor of powers and reallocated them to the city manager. First, in Figure A.3, we replicate
Figure 3 from the body of the paper but employing city name filtering. Specially, we limit the
tmentions of the word “mayor” to only those that appear near the mention of the mayor's home
city. This removes false positives that occur when newspapers discuss other cites’ mayors. As the
plot shows, we continue to find the same pattern of results: in fact, if anything, the decrease in
‘the coverage of mayors and the increase in the coverage of city managers is even more pronounced
‘than before

Second, we also re-do the formal dift-in-dilf estimation from Table 2. ‘The diff-in-dif relies on
‘the so-called “parallel trends\" assumption. Here, we assess the robustness of our results by relaxing,
this assumption. Specifically, we include linear, city-specific time trends. Table A displays the
results, As it shows, the results are nearly identical to those in the paper
A. 2.2 Additional Results on MA Council Reform
In Figure 4, we showed how the coverage of the MA executive council changed after a reform
stripping it of many ofits powers. In that fgure, we used all available newspaper data. Now, we
replicate the analysis but only using the Boston Globe, to make sure the results are not driven by
‘our dataset. We thus recaleulate our relative coverage measure using ouly mentions in the Boston
Globe. Figure Aut presents the results. We contine to see a sharp drop after the reform,

"34"	"2 A Measure of Political Power From Newspaper Text:

In this section, we lay out the iden of using newspaper coverage to measure political power, We
explain the logic of our measure, we discuss what kind of power it is Iikely to tap into, and we
dlscuss its nits and how to interpret i.

2.1 Relative Newspaper Coverage to Measure Relative Power

‘There are many kinds, and many definitions, of power. Newspaper coverage will nly retect some
of these? Shadowy actors who use their influence to avoid media scrutiny, for one obvious example,
cannot be directly studied using newspaper coverage’* But a simpler kind of political power will
inevitably reveal itself im how often newspapers men tion people and offices. In particular, what
‘we will be able to measure is whether, and to what extent, various politi actors and offices
possess the necessary resources and authority to influence political outcomes, i, to “matter” for
‘the political process. To make this idea clearer, consider state party committees in the ently 20¢h
century. Many of these committees possesed important resources: they could choose candidates to
stand for fice, marshal eampaign support for eandidates, and, once elected, could direct economic
resources to loyal party members through patronage. As a result ofall these resources, state party
committees were, in many eases, “powerful”

A direct consequence ofthis kind of power is newsworthiness. ‘Though newspapers have latitude
to choose what they report on—and a variety of biases may’ lead them to omit certain stories
economic necessity and the logic of competition, as well asa basi deste to cover the news, compel
‘them to, by and large, report on matters of consequence. Newspaper coverage of political nctors
and offices therefore reveals who is involved in matters of politial consequence.*

interpreted simply as « measure of power, asthe frequency of newspaper mentions say also be
driven by the ideological preferences of those producing the news. However, the influence of any
present supply-side effets can be reduced by ensuring a adequately balanced representation of
newspapers (in our ease, of both Democratc- and Republiat-leaning newspapers) in the sample

Issues sch as these aio constrain the ways researchers cai se our newspaper-based meas.
Raw counts of the mentions of political actors or ofices are likely to be brondly informative
expecially when aggregated overlong time periods but because of the many other seasons for
coverage they will not be pci. As a result, the newspaper-hased mianre is likely to be wore
suseful as a dependent variable in analyses where exogenous variation in explanatory variables of
interest is present: this exogenous variation will help ensure that findings are not driven by the
soi in the measure.
2.8 Making Valid Comparisons
‘The many other diferences in news coverage also makes comparing the measure across actors and
clfces tricky. If we were to find, for exabnple, that mayors seccive more coverage than governors,
‘we could not immediately conclide that mayors are more “powerful” than governors. Perhaps
newspapers cover mayors more becatse lca news is valuable to readers, nstond. To he meaningful,
any such erosvotice (or erose-actor, oF eras-time) comparison must hold other factors equal. In
seueral, we do this by muking withi-contest, withintine comparisons. Rather than compare
sayors to goveruons, we might compare a mayor to her corresponding city council, for example.
‘These two units occupy the same space at the same time, and as «nest, differences i their local
newspaper coverage are likely to be informative. While ensuring valid comparisons docs limit the
applicability of our measure, it can stil tll us quite bit. ‘The relative powers of a variety of
sctors and offices at the same time and in the same place are at the heart of many of the deepest
questions about political institutions

Another way to make valid comparisons relies on quasi-randons variation ia an explanatory
‘variable, rather than on directly holding tte and contest fixed. Imagine for exanple «randomized
itor no ols tothe ons ge Ka Ren (208) fd ence hat gut he sagt

5
"
"38"	"experiment where the outcome is our newspaper-based measure. Though the reasons for newspaper
coverage will vary over time and serass space, the randomization from the hypothetical experiment
‘would ensure that this variation is unrelated, in expectation, to the treatment we are intersted
in studying. AAs a result we can use the measure for a variety of questions even when we eanmot
hold time and context fixed. Examples of this might include difference-in-diferences designs that
leverage state-level variation in institutional structure, such as studying the effets of term limits
‘or campaign finance reform on the power of a variety of state political offices and actors.

24 Interpreting Relative Coverage: Cardinal or Ordinal?

ven once we have narrowed our focus toa set of comparisons that our newspaper-based measure
‘can examine in a valid mannor, we still must understand how to interpret resulting estimates. We
think of our measure as being largely ordinal-that is, while we can learn a great deal about the

‘the rate of coverage conveys cardinal information about relative power. Put differently, alshough
ir many cases the relationship between coverage and power is monotonic, there is uo reason to
suspect that itis linear, IFA receives 50% more coverage than B then A is probably mote powerful
‘thon B, but it is unlikely that A is exaetly 50% more powesful than B.

In many cases it is not even clear what the statement “A is 50% more powerful than 1\" even
means. That is, in many eases it will be impossible to generate a widely accepted cardinal measure
‘of power because there is not even a widely accepted definition of cardinal power. Almost everyone
‘would agree that the U.S. President is more powerful than any individual US. Senator or US.

Power cat sometimes he defined in cardinal terms, but only in particular cases and in the
context of a highly stylized model. In weighted voting models, for example, the Shapley-Shubik
index (Shapley and Shubile 1954) of the Banzhaf index (e.g, Banzhaf 1968) yield cardinal indices
cof “power.” But these indices focus solely on power that derives from voting—specifically, the
probability that a given player will turn losing coalitions into winning coalitions. ‘They ignore
considerations such as the power to propase, the ability to bargain or to vote strategically in
dynamic settings, or informational asymmetries. They are limited in scope as wel, being designed

2.5 Summary
In this section, we have laid out our concept of using newspaper coverage to measure the relative
power of actors and offices within given contests and time periods. The measure is not universally
pplicable—in part beeanse overly salient subjects can accrue lange excesses of “entertainment
coverage—but it speaks to the power of many kinds of ofices and actors, Having discussed the
reasure theoretically, we now turn to the data we use to apply i
3 New Dataset on Newspaper Text
‘We collected our newspaper text from Newspapers.com, This archive contains the text of millions
of newspaper pages generated vin optical character recognition (OCR). Currently, the Newspa-
pers.com archive has almost 9% million pages from over 3.500 newspapers (they are constantly
‘adding new material). OF these, Newspapers.com has a large amount of material—at least 10,00
‘ages covering five oF more years—for about TOO newspapers. In this paper we use a stratified
sample of 50% fom the archive. We focus on the period 1877-1977, which contains the bulk of the
data

us from perfectly capturing word frequencies, the validity tests below indicate that the remaining

4 Validating the Measure Using Powerful Actors and Offices

4.1 Congressional Committees

In this subsection, we evaluate our mensure inthe context of congressional committes, Commnit-
tees are not equally powerful. ‘The Comittee on Ways and Means, with its responsibility over
‘xzation, tarts, and other evenue-raising nctions, has more jurisdiction, controls more money, and
‘wields greater influenceall i all, more power—than for example the (now defunet) Committee
‘on Merchant Marine. ‘This power diferential is also reflected by committee transfer requests. Some
committee assignments are more desirable than others, due to committees’ differences in power and
prestige, As Ray (1982) observes, members typically strive to obtain assignments to committees
they regard as stronger, and give up assignments they regard as weaker.

During the time period of our data, both pasties deemed the Committees on Ways and Means,
Appropriations, and Rules as the “exclusive” committees of the House. In general, members of
exclusive committees cannot also serve on nonexclusive committees? ‘The Yexclusive™ committee
designation further reflets the desirability and power ofthese committees, These three committees,
‘then, should rank at oF near the top of any power ranking of Congressional committees,

We use the Groseclose an Stewart (1908) rankings as an alternative measure to validate our
power measure, ‘Their method, building on the techniques used by Bullock and Sprague (1969) and
‘by Munger (1988), constructs rankings based on the value members place on committees as reflected
by committee transfers. Groseclose and Stewart do not claim to measure power, but instead aim
