Vector Space Models

Documents live in a space. We calculate distances etc. to look at similarities between texts. 
Geometry
Building block for clustering, supervised learning and scaling. 

Different measures of distance:
- Euclidian
- Manhattan
- Mirowski-family

Mahalanobis Distance is a way of reweighting or scaling. 

Cosine similarity
- Max: the document in itself
- Min: No common word
The most popular measure of similarity.
